Seeking a more collaborative environment, she transitioned to Fidelity\u2019s Registered Investment Advisor Group, covering RIAs nationwide as part of a six-member team. After a layoff, she joined State Street Bank in Boston as a Currency Management Officer for 18 months. Determined to pivot into personal advice, she became a financial advisor at Equitable with Highland Financial Group, where she built ~$10M in AUM during COVID through cold-calling, networking, and tailored planning. She later joined DK Breedy Associates, a boutique firm in Needham, MA with $1.7B AUM. After successive ownership changes culminating in a sale to Focus Financial, she exited in April 2025. Lauren excels at communication, transparency, and building durable trust. A hallmark example includes guiding a newly widowed mother with ~$2M in assets from crisis to clarity, prioritizing empathy and education. She values respect, honesty, and accountability\u2014early in her career, she owned a $50K trading error and corrected it directly with leadership.

He began as a trusts-and-estates paralegal handling probate, trust administration, and estate/gift tax filings, then moved into a community bank\u2019s trust department, turning statute into smooth client operations for fiduciary clients. That legal-to-trust foundation now powers his RIA work (Mosaic, InTouch, Legacy), where he builds eMoney plans, pressure-tests cash flows in advanced Excel, drafts clear client summaries, and supports meetings with practical, plain-English explanations.\n\nCary is calm, precise, and collaborative. He earned the CFP\u00ae while working full-time\u2014studying on his commute, leveraging tuition reimbursement, and finishing coursework with near-perfect marks\u2014evidence of discipline and follow-through. He\u2019s now completing a master\u2019s in Advanced Financial Planning with an estate-planning concentration (expected Summer 2026). He values honesty, fairness, and accommodation; he thrives with leaders who set clear goals and welcome clarifying questions, and he responds with crisp analysis and proactive communication.\n\nA representative win: when a Dodd-Frank change began stalling account transfers at his bank, Cary researched a community-bank exemption, partnered with counsel to cite the exact code, and rewrote the transfer template\u2014restoring turnaround times, reducing escalations from trust officers, and improving client satisfaction. Cary prefers analysis and education over sales, enjoys client-facing time to explain options simply, and is ready to strengthen an RIA\u2019s planning bench\u2014especially where estates, trusts, and tax coordination meet real-world client decisions.",

After gaining early exposure to business development, Jakob briefly explored entrepreneurship before returning to finance with Equitable Advisors and later Robinhood, where he worked through a high-pressure environment during the GameStop IPO. At Robinhood, he earned his Series 9 and 10, stepped into leadership as a team lead, and managed through complex market volatility before his office-wide layoff in 2022.\n\nSince then, Jakob has been with Merrill as a National Financial Solutions Advisor, managing a nationwide book of approximately 130 households and $24M in assets. He recently passed his CFP\u00ae exam (Nov 2023) and officially received his marks in January 2024. His licenses include Series 7, 63, 66, 9, and 10, giving him both advisory depth and supervisory credentials. Jakob thrives in client-facing roles where he can help individuals achieve clarity and confidence in their retirement plans, as demonstrated by a client case where he used planning software to show a client he could retire earlier and with greater financial security.\n\nJakob values integrity, transparency, and continuous professional growth. He is seeking his next step in an environment where he can meet clients face-to-face, collaborate with peers, and expand his career beyond the limited structure of his current national advisory role. With proven production, leadership readiness, and a client-first approach, Jakob is well-positioned to add immediate and long-term value to a growth-oriented RIA or wealth management firm.",

He began his career at Edward Jones, transitioning from a training and development background. Through a disciplined approach and aggressive prospecting, Andy built a $30M book of business in just over three years, starting from zero. He then joined Creative Planning, where his 83% close rate on firm-generated leads helped him grow another book from $0 to $60M in two and a half years. However, managing 600 households with a mix of asset levels prompted a shift in focus.\n\nWhile at Creative Planning and later Advisors Excel, Andy discovered his passion for developing emerging wealth advisors. He was integral to onboarding, coaching, and training new financial professionals, covering topics from appointment setting to holistic planning. At Advisors Excel, he contributed to high-net-worth client presentations, built comprehensive financial plans, and helped design internal sales infrastructure, all while supporting advisors in integrating annuities within broader wealth management strategies.\n\nAndy holds Series 7 and 66 licenses, as well as Life & Health insurance credentials in Kansas. He\u2019s currently completing the CFP program at Kansas State University and expects to sit for the exam in either November 2025 or March 2026. His educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s from Baker University and a master\u2019s from Benedictine College.\n\nDriven by a personal mission stemming from a challenging family financial experience, Andy is passionate about empowering clients to avoid similar struggles. His leadership style values autonomy with feedback and emphasizes integrity, adaptability, and positivity. His ideal next role allows him to serve clients while mentoring others, combining his strongest skills and values in a collaborative team environment.",
