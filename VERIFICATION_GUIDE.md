# Anonymization Verification Guide

## Overview

The `verify_anonymization.py` script scans generated vault alert HTML files to detect confidentiality leaks before deployment. This ensures compliance with privacy standards and protects candidate identities.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Single file scan
python3 verify_anonymization.py boss_format_advisors_20251013.html

# Multiple files
python3 verify_anonymization.py output/*.html

# Strict mode (exit with error if issues found) - useful for CI/CD
python3 verify_anonymization.py --strict boss_format_advisors_20251013.html
```

## What It Checks

### 1. Firm Names (CRITICAL) üö®

‚ùå Currently at Merrill Lynch, managing $450M
‚úÖ 15 years at major wirehouse, managing $400M-$600M
```

### 2. ZIP Codes (CRITICAL) üö®
Finds 5-digit ZIP codes that could pinpoint locations:

**Example Violations:**

RECOMMENDATION:
üö® CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - DO NOT DEPLOY
   Fix firm names, ZIP codes, and exact AUM figures before sending.

======================================================================
```

## Severity Levels

### üö® CRITICAL (Must Fix Before Deployment)
- **Firm Names**: Direct breach of confidentiality
- **ZIP Codes**: Enables precise location tracking
- **Exact AUM**: Fingerprints specific advisors

**Action Required**: Fix all critical issues immediately. Files with critical issues should NOT be deployed.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (Review Recommended)
- **Universities**: Less critical but still identifying
- **Unique Identifiers**: May reveal identity through achievements
- **Specific Locations**: Narrows geographic area too much

**Action Recommended**: Review and consider generalizing. Not deployment-blocking but should be addressed.

## Usage Modes

### Standard Scan
```bash
python3 verify_anonymization.py boss_format_advisors_20251013.html
```
Shows full report with all findings and line numbers.

### Strict Mode (CI/CD)
```bash
python3 verify_anonymization.py --strict boss_format_advisors_20251013.html
echo $?  # Exit code: 0 = no issues, 1 = issues found
```
Use in automated pipelines to block deployment if issues exist.

### Multi-File Scan
```bash
python3 verify_anonymization.py output/*.html
```
Scans multiple files and shows aggregate summary:
```
Multi-File Summary (3 files)

```

## Installation

### Requirements
```bash
# Optional: colorama for colored output
pip install colorama

# Script works without colorama but output is monochrome
```

### Make Executable
```bash
chmod +x verify_anonymization.py
```

## Integration with Vault Alert Workflow

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
1. Generate HTML files using `generate_boss_format_langgraph.py`
2. Run verification: `python3 verify_anonymization.py output/*.html`
3. Review findings and fix critical issues
4. Re-run verification until 100% pass rate on critical checks
5. Manual review of warnings
6. Deploy via email scheduler

### Automated Pipeline (Future)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Weekly vault alert generation with verification

# Generate alerts
python3 app/jobs/vault_alerts_generator.py

# Verify anonymization
python3 verify_anonymization.py --strict output/*.html

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Verification passed - deploying alerts"
    python3 app/jobs/vault_alerts_scheduler.py
else
    echo "üö® Verification failed - alerts NOT deployed"
    # Send notification to admin
    exit 1
fi
```

## False Positives

The script is designed to minimize false positives:

1. **Generic Education References**: "prestigious business school" is allowed
2. **Location Names**: "Miami" in geographic context is allowed (not "Miami University")
3. **AUM Ranges**: "$800M-$1.2B" is acceptable (ranges are good)
4. **Generic Achievements**: "top producer" is allowed (specific rankings are not)

## Customization

To add more patterns to scan, edit the class constants in `verify_anonymization.py`:

```python
class AnonymizationScanner:
    FIRM_NAMES = [...]        # Add more firms
    UNIVERSITIES = [...]       # Add more schools
    UNIQUE_IDENTIFIERS = [...]  # Add more patterns
    SPECIFIC_LOCATIONS = [...]  # Add more suburbs
```

## Testing

Test file included: `test_anonymization_sample.html`

```bash
# Test the script with sample violations
python3 verify_anonymization.py test_anonymization_sample.html
```

Expected output: Multiple violations across all categories.
