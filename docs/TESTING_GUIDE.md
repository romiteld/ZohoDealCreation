# Financial Advisor Extraction Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive testing methodologies for validating financial advisor data extraction using Brandon's real candidate examples.

## Testing Framework Overview

### Test Categories
1. **Pattern Recognition Tests** - Verify regex patterns capture data correctly
2. **Field Mapping Tests** - Ensure extracted data maps to correct Zoho fields
3. **Business Logic Tests** - Validate deal name formatting and source determination
4. **Edge Case Tests** - Handle incomplete or ambiguous data
5. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end extraction and CRM creation
6. **Regression Tests** - Ensure new patterns don't break existing functionality

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Pre-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Test with all real Brandon examples from the HTML file
- [ ] Verify AUM amounts are correctly converted to numeric values
- [ ] Confirm license extraction handles all format variations
- [ ] Check designation parsing including in-progress status
- [ ] Validate geographic and mobility constraint extraction
- [ ] Ensure values statements are preserved exactly
- [ ] Test compensation range parsing for all formats
- [ ] Verify deal name formatting follows business rules
- [ ] Confirm Zoho field mapping is complete and accurate
- [ ] Test error handling for malformed input data

#### Performance Validation
- [ ] Processing time < 2 seconds for typical emails
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during batch processing
- [ ] Error rates < 1% for well-formatted input
- [ ] Graceful degradation for partial data

#### Integration Validation
- [ ] Zoho API calls succeed with extracted data
- [ ] Contact records created with all mapped fields
- [ ] Deal records linked correctly to contacts
- [ ] Company records created when applicable
- [ ] Source determination logic works correctly
- [ ] Owner assignment uses environment variable

This testing guide ensures comprehensive validation of the financial advisor extraction system using Brandon's proven data patterns and business requirements.
