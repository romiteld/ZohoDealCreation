# Production Readiness Status - Well Intake API
## Date: 2025-08-30

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

This application has **THREE main components**:

### 1. **Outlook Add-in (PRIMARY INTERFACE)** ✅ DEPLOYED
- **Status**: Deployed and serving from Container App
- **URL**: https://well-intake-api.wittyocean-dfae0f9b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io
- **Manifest**: Version 1.1.0.1 (updated with new URLs)
- **Functionality**: Adds "Send to Zoho" button to Outlook ribbon
- **Files served**: commands.html, taskpane.html, all JS/icons

### 2. **FastAPI Backend** ✅ DEPLOYED
- **Status**: Running on Azure Container Apps
- **Features**:
  - LangGraph workflow for email processing
  - GPT-5-mini for data extraction
  - Redis caching for cost optimization
  - PostgreSQL with pgvector for deduplication
  - Azure Blob Storage for attachments
- **Health**: API operational, Redis connected, DB connected

### 3. **Voice UI Web App** ❌ NOT DEPLOYED
- **Status**: Local files only, needs deployment
- **Location**: /outlook/voice-ui/
- **Requirements**: Needs Azure Static Web App or separate deployment

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Container App**: Running latest Docker image with new URLs
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL Flexible Server connected
3. **Redis Cache**: Connected and operational
4. **Blob Storage**: Created and configured
5. **Manifest**: Updated to version 1.1.0.1 with correct URLs
6. **Static Files**: All add-in files accessible from Container App

## ❌ What's Missing for Production

### Critical Items:
1. **Outlook Add-in Installation**
   - Add-in NOT installed in any Outlook clients yet
   - Users need to manually add via manifest URL
   - Or deploy via Microsoft 365 Admin Center

2. **Zoho OAuth Configuration**
   - OAuth service showing "error" in health check
   - Needs Zoho credentials configured
   - OAuth proxy may need deployment

3. **Voice UI Deployment**
   - Currently just local files
   - Needs Azure Static Web App deployment
   - Or integration into main Container App

## 📋 Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Outlook Add-in (IMMEDIATE)
```
For Individual Users:
1. Go to https://outlook.office.com
2. Click "Get Add-ins" → "My add-ins" → "Custom Add-ins"
3. Click "Add from URL"
4. Enter: https://well-intake-api.wittyocean-dfae0f9b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/manifest.xml
5. Click "Install"

For Organization (Microsoft 365 Admin):
1. Go to Microsoft 365 Admin Center
2. Settings → Integrated apps
3. Upload custom app → From URL
4. Enter manifest URL
5. Assign to users/groups
```

### Step 2: Configure Zoho OAuth (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Set Zoho credentials in Container App
az containerapp update --name well-intake-api \
  --resource-group TheWell-Infra-East \
  --set-env-vars \
    ZOHO_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id" \
    ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET="your-secret" \
    ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN="your-refresh-token"
```

### Step 3: Deploy Voice UI (OPTIONAL)
```bash
# Option A: Azure Static Web App
cd /home/romiteld/outlook/voice-ui
az staticwebapp create --name well-voice-ui \
  --resource-group TheWell-Infra-East \
  --source . \
  --location eastus

# Option B: Add to Container App
# Modify Dockerfile to serve voice-ui files
```

### Step 4: Configure Monitoring
```bash
# Already has Application Insights connection string
# Need to set up alerts for:
- API errors > 5%
- Response time > 3 seconds
- Zoho API failures
- Redis cache hit rate < 50%
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Outlook Add-in Testing:
- [ ] Install add-in in Outlook Web
- [ ] Open any email
- [ ] Click "Send to Zoho" button
- [ ] Verify taskpane opens
- [ ] Check fields are pre-populated
- [ ] Test "Send to Zoho CRM" button
- [ ] Verify records created in Zoho

### API Testing:
- [ ] Health endpoint returns "healthy"
- [ ] Test Kevin Sullivan sample endpoint
- [ ] Process real recruitment email
- [ ] Verify Redis caching works
- [ ] Check PostgreSQL deduplication

### Voice UI Testing (when deployed):
- [ ] Access voice interface
- [ ] Test voice commands
- [ ] Verify API integration

## 📊 Current Service Status

| Service | Status | URL/Details |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Container App | ✅ Running | https://well-intake-api.wittyocean-dfae0f9b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io |
| PostgreSQL | ✅ Connected | well-intake-db.postgres.database.azure.com |
| Redis Cache | ✅ Connected | well-intake-cache-v2.redis.cache.windows.net |
| Blob Storage | ✅ Created | wellintakestorage.blob.core.windows.net |
| Zoho OAuth | ❌ Error | Needs credentials |
| Voice UI | ❌ Not Deployed | Local files only |
| Outlook Add-in | ⚠️ Deployed but not installed | Needs user action |

## 🚀 Go-Live Requirements

### Minimum for Production:
1. ✅ Container App deployed
2. ✅ Database connected
3. ✅ Redis connected
4. ⚠️ Outlook add-in installed (USER ACTION NEEDED)
5. ❌ Zoho OAuth configured (REQUIRED)

### Nice to Have:
- Voice UI deployment
- Monitoring alerts
- User documentation
- Admin deployment

## 📝 Next Actions

1. **COMPLETED**: Fixed manifest structure and Content-Type header (v1.1.0.2)
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Install add-in in Outlook clients using the manifest URL
3. **URGENT**: Configure Zoho OAuth credentials
4. **IMPORTANT**: Test end-to-end workflow with real email
5. **OPTIONAL**: Deploy voice UI if needed

## 🔗 Important URLs

- **Manifest**: https://well-intake-api.wittyocean-dfae0f9b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/manifest.xml
- **Health Check**: https://well-intake-api.wittyocean-dfae0f9b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/health
- **Test Endpoint**: https://well-intake-api.wittyocean-dfae0f9b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/test/kevin-sullivan

## 💡 Summary

The application is **75% ready for production**. The backend infrastructure is fully deployed and operational. The main missing pieces are:
1. Installing the Outlook add-in in user clients (manual action required)
2. Configuring Zoho OAuth credentials (critical for functionality)
3. Optionally deploying the voice UI component

Once the Outlook add-in is installed and Zoho credentials are configured, the application will be fully functional for processing recruitment emails and creating Zoho CRM records.
