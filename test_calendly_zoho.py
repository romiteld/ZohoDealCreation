What recruiting goals or ideas would you like to discuss?

Plan to hire 2 new lead advisors as soon as possible. I have a preliminary offer out to one at this time. Not sure if it will be accepted. Then hire a third CSA in 2026 . Then hire two associate advisors in 2027. Then Hire another lead advisor, probably in 2028. We are in Tulsa, prefer to hire locally (within 2-hour drive) but open to discussing other markets.

Your confirmation email might land in spam/junk.

Got it- I'll check my spam/junk
