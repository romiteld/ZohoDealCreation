# Evidence Extraction Refactor Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the evidence extraction system in `/home/romiteld/outlook/app/extract/evidence.py` to focus on financial advisor metrics instead of tech skills.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated BulletCategory Enum
**Old categories (tech-focused):**
- `HARD_SKILL` - Python, Java, AWS, etc.
- `SOFT_SKILL` - Leadership, communication, etc.

**New categories (financial-focused):**
- `FINANCIAL_METRIC` - AUM, production, book size
- `GROWTH_ACHIEVEMENT` - Growth metrics and achievements
- `CLIENT_METRIC` - Client count, retention, relationships
- `PERFORMANCE_RANKING` - Rankings and performance metrics

### 2. Completely Replaced Pattern Matching

**Removed tech patterns:**
- Programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- Cloud technologies (AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Development tools and frameworks

**Added financial patterns:**
- **AUM/Book Size**: `$2.2B RIA`, `$500M AUM`, `manages $350M`
- **Production**: `$5M annual production`, `$10M+ in new AUM`
- **Growth**: `grew from $200M to $1B`, `scaled from $300M to $1B+`
- **Rankings**: `#1-3 nationally`, `top tier close rate 47%`
- **Client Metrics**: `250 HNW clients`, `97-99% retention`

### 3. Enhanced Pattern Robustness
- **Decimal point protection**: Fixed sentence splitting on "$2.2B"
- **Tilde support**: Handles `~$150M` formats
- **Case insensitive**: Works with "AUM", "aum", "Aum"
- **Flexible formatting**: Supports various number formats (B, M, K, billion, million)

### 4. Improved Categorization Logic
- **Priority-based**: Growth achievements take precedence over basic financial metrics
- **Context-aware**: Multi-aspect texts categorized by most significant pattern
- **Evidence-linked**: All categories require appropriate evidence

## Test Results

**100% Success Rate** on all test cases from Brandon's real financial advisor examples:

✅ **Built $2.2B RIA** → Financial Metric
✅ **Managed ~$500M AUM...ranked top tier** → Performance Ranking
✅ **Previously grew $43M book to $72M** → Growth Achievement
✅ **Growing AUM from ~$150M to $720M** → Growth Achievement
✅ **Repeatedly ranked #1–3 nationally** → Performance Ranking
✅ **Personally raised $2B+ AUM** → Financial Metric
✅ **Manages $350M across 65 relationships** → Client Metric
✅ **Holds Series 7, 63, 65** → Licenses
✅ **Scaled firms from $300M to $1B+** → Growth Achievement
✅ **35+ new clients/month, 97–99% retention** → Client Metric

## Pattern Examples

### AUM/Financial Metrics
- `$2.2B RIA`
- `$500M AUM`
- `manages $350M across 65 relationships`
- `$1.5B+ in client assets`
- `book size of $720M`
- `oversees $10M to $150M portfolios`

### Growth Achievements
- `grew from $200M to $1B`
- `scaled from $300M to $1B+`
- `increased AUM by 300%`
- `doubled production in 2 years`
- `expanded book from $43M to $72M`
- `growing AUM from ~$150M to $720M`

### Performance Rankings
- `ranked #1-3 nationally`
- `top tier close rate 47%`
- `President's Club member`
- `#2 in the nation`
- `top 5% performer`
- `Circle of Champions`

### Client Metrics
- `250 HNW clients`
- `65 relationships`
- `35+ new clients/month`
- `97-99% retention`
- `serving 100+ families`

## Tech Pattern Removal Verification
✅ **Confirmed**: Old tech patterns like "Python, Java, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes" are completely ignored and categorized as generic `EXPERIENCE` with no evidence extraction.

## Impact
This refactor ensures the evidence extraction system now properly identifies and categorizes the financial achievements and metrics that matter for advisor recruitment, completely replacing the inappropriate tech skill focus with relevant financial services patterns.
