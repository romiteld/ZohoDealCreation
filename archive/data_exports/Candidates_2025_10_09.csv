While there, he managed a substantial $650 million book across 400 households, working with a coordinated support team including a client service associate, planning consultant, and financial representative. His role focused heavily on transitioning assets from institutional 401(k)s into managed money on the retail side, with a high-touch, CRM-driven service model.

Post-Fidelity, Ryan moved into the independent advisory space, contributing to ensemble RIA practices across various regions, including a $60M book at a fintech startup, $330M at Capstone (Henderson, NV) supporting ~200 households, and $100M at Clark, managing 80 clients. His experience reflects a consistent emphasis on collaboration, relationship building, and delivering high-quality service, rather than high-pressure sales or outbound prospecting.

Ryan holds an MBA from UNLV’s Lee Business School, a CFP® designation earned after completing the UC Berkeley Extension certificate program, and multiple securities licenses including the Series 7, 63, 66, 9, and 10.

Jonathan Nickel is a seasoned Financial Planner with approximately 15 years of experience helping individuals and families grow, protect, and transfer wealth. He built and eventually sold his own book of business, demonstrating his ability to build trust, develop long-term client relationships, and deliver value-driven planning solutions. He has a gift for understanding client needs and takes a purpose-driven approach to financial advising, rooted in empathy and a desire to help others grow their legacy.

Jonathan recently worked in the oil and gas sector, raising capital for a mineral royalty fund. In that role, he raised over $7 million from 50+ unique investors through a mix of cold calling, warm leads, and strategic networking at trade shows and events. Although successful in that position, the fund concluded and he is now seeking a return to traditional financial advising—a space he finds deeply rewarding and aligned with his passion for people.

He brings a strong foundation in retirement planning, insurance, and investment strategy, backed by a comprehensive licensing portfolio and advanced training through CRPC® and RICP® programs.

His primary responsibilities focused on comprehensive financial planning—including retirement income, tax strategies, estate, incapacity, charitable, and family planning.

Dave is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) since 2019, and he also holds the Series 7, Series 66, and Life & Health Insurance licenses. His professional philosophy is rooted in what he calls the ""3 C’s"": Care, Competency, and Clarity. He distinguishes himself by building deep, personal client relationships—often becoming a trusted part of their extended family circle. One example of this: several clients gifted him items for his newborn daughter, a gesture he considers his most meaningful career metric.

He has consistently met and exceeded targets (often achieving 100–150% of goal), though he doesn’t position himself as a ""top-of-the-leaderboard"" advisor. Instead, his strength lies in long-term relationship management, genuine care, and high-quality, personalized service. Dave thrives in environments where he can work independently while checking in with leadership through regular 1:1s. He prepares thoroughly, brings agendas to meetings, and values structured support.

Looking ahead, Dave is seeking to transition to an RIA environment, which he believes aligns better with his client-first ethos.

He joined the firm full-time post-graduation and helped grow it from a small shop into a $1.5B AUM firm.

He’s a natural mentor and team builder, having built and led high-performing cross-functional groups across operations, product, and client success.

Steve has a deep background in launching and scaling financial firms (including co-founding his own), implementing process automation, and driving operational turnarounds. He’s led initiatives that slashed escalations by 90%, doubled team capacity, and boosted client onboarding efficiency—while also reporting directly to boards and building dashboards for strategic KPIs.

With strong presentation chops and a talent for building client trust, he excels at representing teams both internally and externally. Whether guiding internal transformations or improving client experience at scale, Steve brings calm clarity and a strong leadership presence to the table.

In short: Visionary operator. Trusted mentor. Metrics nerd (in the best way). Big heart.

There, he performed portfolio analysis, manager searches, asset allocation design, and presented recommendations directly to trustee boards.

He also served as a subject matter resource for investment-related questions across the advisor base, bridging gaps for planners less experienced in portfolio construction.

Over time, his remote work arrangement from Uruguay—where he lived for 14 years—ended when the firm shifted to an in-office requirement, and his responsibilities were split among three people.

He previously held Series 7, 24, 55, 65, and 66 licenses and is open to reinstating them if required.

Sean values honesty, sincerity, and self-awareness, and thrives in environments where feedback is direct and constructive.

Brad’s edge is communication: he centers authenticity, transparency, and the “golden rule,” believing trust and likability precede technical advice. He describes the advisor’s craft as diagnosing problems, clarifying impact, and co-creating a tailored solution—stressing that information without context is commoditized, but great advice is personal.

He’s now completing a master’s in Advanced Financial Planning with an estate-planning concentration (expected Summer 2026). He values honesty, fairness, and accommodation; he thrives with leaders who set clear goals and welcome clarifying questions, and he responds with crisp analysis and proactive communication.

A representative win: when a Dodd-Frank change began stalling account transfers at his bank, Cary researched a community-bank exemption, partnered with counsel to cite the exact code, and rewrote the transfer template—restoring turnaround times, reducing escalations from trust officers, and improving client satisfaction.

He entered wealth management after early career stints in research (Naval Research Lab) and sales, accumulating experience across Wells Fargo, Old Point Trust, Vanguard, and most recently Marmo Financial Group. At Vanguard he advised $1–5MM households through the COVID-era volatility, demonstrating steady, empathetic coaching. One notable case: a client ready to capitulate to cash on a Friday; Greg de-escalated emotions, set a cooling-off plan, and held daily accountability calls—ultimately keeping the client invested with positive subsequent outcomes.

At Old Point Trust he focused on new business: meeting prospects, building financial plans, implementing, then handing off to administration—an environment that sharpened discovery, plan design, and clear handoffs. He later joined Marmo to re-engage an underserved 2,000-client book; in the first half of the year he surfaced and captured >$10MM in net new assets from existing relationships by proactive reviews and needs-based planning. Earlier, he closed 24 retirement plans in one year (~$50MM AUA), leveraging centers of influence, including bank partners and attorneys.

From 2019 to mid-2022 he supported a senior advisor’s ~$150M AUM practice while fielding friends-and-family relationships. His remit spanned pre-meeting prep, opportunity spotting, insurance and annuity reviews, portfolio coordination, and client follow-ups—always aimed at higher-quality meetings and cleaner execution.

Mac’s standout operating system is expectations management. Two weeks before reviews, he drove checklists (pay stubs, 401(k) statements, trust docs), followed by a one-week nudge, and rescheduled if inputs lagged—ensuring every meeting had the data to produce decisions. That discipline translated into growth: during his Hance tenure, the book scaled from ~$75M to ~$150M AUM, with multi-line penetration (home/auto, life, annuities, mortgages) rising to ~85% of clients, supported by a six-person team. He later joined Edward Jones and then co-founded at Upstream; the latter wasn’t the right fit culturally, reinforcing that Mac’s highest impact comes as the right hand to a lead advisor where he can structure workflows, surface opportunities, and elevate client experience.

Beginning his career in 1997 at Condor Capital, then a young $100M AUM firm, he was fast-tracked to partner by age 27. Over nearly 20 years, he played a pivotal role in scaling the firm to approximately $1B in assets, maintaining an exceptional client retention rate of ~98%.

Brian is known for his strong communication and listening skills, ensuring clients feel understood and confident in their financial plans. His primary focus is guiding near-retirees and retirees, running comprehensive financial projections, addressing estate planning needs, and helping them make informed decisions about retirement readiness. He emphasizes clarity and avoids jargon, tailoring discussions to client preferences—ranging from simple explanations to deep analysis of ETFs, equities, and market strategies.

A hallmark of his approach is proactive client outreach during market downturns. Rather than waiting for calls in times of panic, Brian reaches out to reassure clients, revisit projections, and reinforce long-term discipline. He also fosters multigenerational trust, establishing 529 plans, reviewing young adult clients’ 401(k) choices, and positioning himself as the family’s long-term financial partner.

In addition to servicing clients, Brian has demonstrated consistent success in business development. He has historically converted 85–90% of referred prospects, including challenging cases from Schwab and TD Ameritrade branch networks, while also generating strong word-of-mouth growth.

Retention averaged 97–99%, pairing high-intent inbound with a disciplined onboarding engine, service consistency, and clear advisor capacity planning.

Recruited as CEO by 10CAP, he repeated the playbook at speed: from one office/one advisor to seven offices and a team of eight, on pace to close 2025 near ~$350M AUM. He diagnoses growth bottlenecks across the funnel—brand, traffic, conversion, capacity—and then builds repeatable systems so advisors can stay in meetings while the firm scales responsibly.

A former Chief Compliance Officer (eight years) with clean SEC exams, Joe blends creativity with governance. He reframed SEO as “Search Everywhere Optimization,” ensuring the firm is findable across modern channels, and strengthened conversion by redesigning first-meeting narratives (lifting sub-40% close rates toward top-tier benchmarks).

Early in his career, Steven demonstrated strong judgment during the 2000 tech crash, leading his firm to exit overvalued tech positions and preserve client capital—a decisive asset allocation call that set him apart. He went on to co-found and run a global research firm, launch a U.S.-based mutual fund and ETF, and ultimately sell the strategies to Axis Investments in 2024. Steven continues to serve as portfolio manager for the ETF while pursuing his next professional chapter.

Steven is now intentionally pivoting into wealth management, pursuing his CFP and aligning with Arthur Brooks’ “second curve” framework—shifting from innovator to teacher and mentor. He is motivated by a desire to build meaningful client relationships, apply his decades of investment management experience, and serve clients with wisdom and clarity. Notably, Steven combines his deep market background with newly acquired technical fluency, completing a graduate certificate in computer science (SQL, Python, AI applications) and daily exploration of large language models. He sees technology as a force multiplier for advisors, freeing time for deeper client engagement and better outcomes.

Beyond technical and investment expertise, Steven has a lifelong pattern of discipline, adaptability, and learning—exemplified by his ambidextrous lacrosse career and later commitment to mastering computer science mid-career. He thrives at translating complex financial and economic concepts into clear client guidance and enjoys mentoring younger professionals.

After college, he joined a fast-growing Tucson RIA (the firm doubled during his tenure). He began in operations—owning planning workflows, data integrity, portfolio model administration, trading platform oversight, and checklist design to prevent input errors—then was promoted to a client-facing advisor role when an advisor departed. Eli inherited a partial book and retained ~80% of those relationships, citing both his follow-through and a culture that inspired client confidence. From that base (~$15M AUM), he drove significant organic growth by closing firm-sourced and cold opportunities and converting referrals at a very high rate; his book grew to roughly $43M across ~90 households in ~2.5 years.

Beyond production, Eli brings depth in complex planning: Social Security optimization (e.g., survivor vs. personal benefit timing strategies), tax-aware drawdown and Roth conversion modeling, and insurance remediation (unwinding/problem-solving old policies with loans to avoid surprise taxation). He coaches owner-operators on compensation decisions to balance near-term tax minimization with long-term retirement and Social Security outcomes. He also builds custom, values-aligned portfolio models to meet ethical screens without sacrificing objective allocation needs.

Since leaving the RIA, Eli launched an independent practice while contracting as a para-planner to a network of advisors. He produces written plans and advanced analyses across eMoney, MoneyGuidePro, RightCapital, Income Lab, and more—demonstrating tool-agnostic fluency and strong documentation habits.

In 2024, she launched her own firm, where she continues to serve clients.

Huyen’s strength lies in her deep client relationship skills. She emphasizes active listening and building trust, tailoring advice to meet clients where they are in their financial journey. One powerful example includes helping a client in her 60s with little retirement savings move past financial trauma and finally begin saving for her future—highlighting Huyen’s patience, empathy, and ability to drive real change.

Her achievements reflect resilience and discipline: balancing single motherhood, full-time work, and graduate school simultaneously, then going on to establish her own business. She views her role as both advisor and teacher, guiding clients toward small but transformative financial changes.

Huyen holds the CFP® designation, Series 65, and a master’s in finance. She previously held life and health insurance licenses but chose to focus fully on planning. She has future plans to obtain her Enrolled Agent designation to deepen her expertise in tax planning.

Recruited into Morgan Stanley’s FA program, he completed their rigorous boot camp before joining Merrill Lynch’s advanced training program.

He is versatile across insurance, investments, and estate planning, and he’s equally skilled at guiding both new and established wealth clients.

He then shifted to mid-cycle consulting sales at CorePay, partnering with AP leaders and CFOs to streamline payable workflows and guide ERP-aligned implementations—sharpening discovery, process mapping, and change-management skills.

Drawn back to startups, Ryan broke into the Northeast for Squire, building GTM motions from scratch—standardizing discovery, defining pipeline stages, and adapting messaging to an unconventional buyer (barbershop owners). He later excelled in medical device sales at Eargo, moving from B2B to B2C with ease: 130% average quota attainment and #2 of 35 in post-sale customer satisfaction.

Most recently, at Vanguard (Retail Investor Group), Alex posted a 52% close rate on new advisory accounts—well above target—demonstrating strong discovery, trust-building, and conversion skills in a team-based model.

Motivationally, Alex thrives where clear goals, mentorship, and client-first culture intersect. He values honesty, integrity, and compassion, and is known for uncovering the “real” drivers of client decisions and guiding them toward action. Relevant results include consistent top-of-funnel conversion, public presentation experience, and a history of creating order from ambiguity—useful for a high-lead-flow, culture-carrier role.

He started in the industry at 14 with a national private financial firm, learning operations, paperwork, and client service before earning a B.A. in Economics from the University of Oregon. While in college he sharpened his outreach skills in the Annual Giving program, piloting a targeted alumni initiative that helped convert warm leads into commitments totaling ~$500K+—evidence of his persistence, listening, and consultative approach.

As a producing advisor (2012–2018), JT did the hard things: 100+ cold calls/day, door-knocking, systematic referral cultivation, and disciplined follow-through. A representative win: he nurtured a prospect for two years with quarterly value-add calls, ultimately preventing a costly 401(k) cash-out and landing his first $1MM+ rollover. In 2018 he sold his practice for a bit over 2× revenue to rescue a struggling family brewery ($750K debt, losing $50K/month). He grew revenue from ~$300K to ~$1.2MM and scaled to 16 employees in 24 months; COVID ultimately forced closure in 2023. Since then, he has consulted as a fractional/CEO advisor to several sub-$10MM businesses.

JT is values-anchored—Integrity, Accountability, Collaboration—and motivated by helping ordinary families reach goals through clear planning and consistent execution.
