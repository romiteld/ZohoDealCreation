## 🎉 What We Just Did

**Changed DMARC Policy:**
- **FROM:** `p=quarantine` (send suspicious emails to spam)
- **TO:** `p=none` (monitor only, deliver to inbox)

**Record Updated:**
```
v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; pct=100; fo=1; rua=mailto:df5260b9c437405c88c96ccecde98e0e@dmarc-reports.cloudflare.net,mailto:carlos.martinez@emailthewell.com;
```

## ⏰ Current Status

### DNS Propagation: IN PROGRESS ⏳

**What's Happening:**
- Cloudflare has saved your changes ✅
- DNS servers worldwide are updating (5-30 minutes)
- Old policy still cached in some servers temporarily

**Timeline:**
- **Right now:** Change saved in Cloudflare
- **5-10 min:** Cloudflare DNS updated
- **15-30 min:** Most DNS servers updated
- **30-60 min:** Global propagation complete

## 🔍 How to Check Progress

**Option 1: Use the Verification Script**
```bash
cd /home/romiteld/Development/Desktop_Apps/outlook
./verify_dmarc_fix.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual Check**
```bash
dig _dmarc.emailthewell.com TXT +short
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Should contain: `p=none`
- ✅ Should contain: `sp=none`
- ✅ Should contain: `pct=100`
- ✅ Should contain: `fo=1`

## 📧 What to Expect

### Immediate (Next Few Hours)
- Some emails may still go to spam (old DNS cached)
- New DNS servers will use new policy
- Gradual improvement in deliverability

### Within 24 Hours
- 95%+ emails should deliver to inbox
- Calendly confirmations reaching recipients
- Normal business communication restored

### Within 48 Hours
- Full global DNS propagation
- All email servers using new policy

## 📊 Monitoring Plan

### Week 1: Observation
**Daily checks:**
- [ ] Ask sales team: Are emails reaching clients?
- [ ] Monitor: Calendly confirmation delivery
- [ ] Review: DMARC reports in carlos.martinez@emailthewell.com

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Customer feedback improves
- ✅ No complaints about missing emails
- ✅ Appointment confirmations delivered

### Weeks 2-4: Analysis
**Review DMARC aggregate reports:**
- Total emails sent per day
- SPF pass rate (should be ~100%)
- DKIM pass rate (should be ~100%)
- DMARC alignment rate
- Sources of any failures

**Action items:**
- Document any authentication failures
- Identify unauthorized senders
- Fix any SPF/DKIM issues discovered

### Months 2-3: Future Planning
**After confirming 100% authentication success:**
- Consider gradual re-enforcement
- Start with 10% quarantine on subdomains
- Increase to 100% over several weeks
- Implement BIMI for logo in inbox (requires p=quarantine)
