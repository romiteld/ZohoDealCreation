Adam and Steve discussed their respective business models, potential collaborations, and strategies for acquiring new clients and advisors. They explored the possibility of recruiting insurance-based financial advisors to their existing business model and discussed potential partnership and referral fee arrangements. The conversation concluded with the potential for further growth through referrals and the sharing of materials for potential use. 
	
Next steps 
	
• Adam to send Steve a sample referral fee agreement and value proposition deck. 
• Adam to provide Steve with access to the 1seven advisor website for more information on their recruiting process. 
• Steve to review the materials from Adam and consider potential partnership opportunities. 


Summary 
	
Sales Cycle and Value Propositions 
Adam and Steve discussed the sales cycle and value propositions of their firm. Adam outlined a three-step process for most advisors, focusing on empowerment, opportunity, and possibility. He highlighted the firm's lead generation capabilities, including college funding and marketing programs. Adam also mentioned the possibility of succession planning or selling the book of business, and the potential for a higher valuation through a special purpose vehicle. Steve expressed interest and admiration for the discussed strategies. 
	
Exploring Business Models and Collaboration 
Adam and Steve discussed their respective business models and potential collaborations. Steve, whose company was founded to service insurance broker dealers and inexperienced advisor recruiting, expressed interest in working with Adam's team but noted that their model might not align with Adam's needs. Adam's team, which focuses on recruiting experienced advisors, was seen as a unique proposition by Steve. However, Steve was unsure if his company could meet Adam's requirements for recruiting high-performing teams. The conversation ended with Steve suggesting that Adam's team might benefit from his company's in-house recruiting capabilities for other projects. 
	
Recruiting Insurance Advisors for Expansion 
Adam and Steve discussed the potential of recruiting insurance-based financial advisors to their existing business model. Adam's company, College Funding Evolution, has a successful lead generation system for life and annuity, but it's currently underutilized. Steve suggested that they could potentially recruit advisors from other companies, such as Northwestern Mutual or New York Life, who are looking to expand their business. Adam agreed to consider this option, noting that they could potentially earn a significant amount of money from each successful recruitment. They also discussed the possibility of working with Steve's company to recruit new advisors or agents. 
	
Acquiring New Clients and Advisors 
Adam and Steve discussed strategies for acquiring new clients and advisors. Adam shared his approach of using free reports and automated marketing funnels to target advisors from Wells Fargo and other banks, and then converting them to their platform. He also mentioned the use of Zoom Info for cold emailing and Hubspot for lead management. Adam's team has successfully acquired a 100 million dollar team and is now focusing on larger advisors. Steve expressed interest in Adam's approach and suggested the potential for collaboration. 
	
Exploring Partnership and Referral Fees 
Steve and Adam discussed potential partnership and referral fee arrangements. Adam expressed openness to various models, including a business owner to business owner model. They also discussed the possibility of a large team moving to their company, which could result in a significant commission for Steve. Adam offered to send Steve their standard contract for review and suggested the possibility of a lead generation program and joint venture. Steve confirmed that his company is his own venture. 
	
Exploring Partnerships and Growth Opportunities 
Adam and Steve discussed potential partnerships and collaborations. Adam proposed a referral fee system for Steve's business, which could generate $50 per report pulled. They also discussed the possibility of Steve's business referring clients to Adam's, which could lead to further growth. Adam offered to share materials, including a sample agreement, for Steve to review and potentially use. They also discussed the impressive growth of Adam's business, which has expanded from 1.3 billion to 5.1 billion in just 2.5 years.

Olivia Vallejo: we've also tried hiring through. Indeed, that also didn't really work for us. I think it's just too general. It's hard to like find someone in specific we had.

00:04:19.387 --> 00:04:25.499
Olivia Vallejo: we would only ask them to come into the office from 8, 30 to 2, and then we'll see you at 5,

32
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.879
Olivia Vallejo: or we'll see you at 5, 30.

33
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.800
Steve Perry: Sure. Yeah. Okay, so some ability to do that.

34
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.591
Olivia Vallejo: So yeah, in like a reliable transportation.

35
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.923
Steve Perry: Right? Yeah.

36
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.716
Steve Perry: okay, that's great. And any

37
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.469
Steve Perry: are are you the one who would be ultimately making the decision hiring this person? Or is there are.

38
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:57.119
Olivia Vallejo: Well, I would do. The 1st 2 interviews like how we did with, indeed, is that we did an over the phone interview, and then we did an in person interview, and then, Brad, he's our advisor. He would meet with them before making the final decision.

39
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.094
Steve Perry: Okay, great, great.

40
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.918
Steve Perry: Well, I'll tell you a little bit about what we do and and how our our process works.

41
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:14.880
Steve Perry: and then I? Yeah. So I'll share that first, st and then kind of talk a little bit more about. Have you guys worked with a recruiting firm at all before you said you mentioned with advisor excel.

42
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:28.043
Olivia Vallejo: Yes, advisors, it's so hard one. It was before I started working with the firm. I just know that it was actually for my position. And they had someone come in as a temp, and it didn't work out. They just

43
00:05:28.673 --> 00:05:49.366
Olivia Vallejo: didn't have reliable transportation, and I think one of the main things, I guess, in the position is being able to use a computer. And there isn't anything that you necessarily have to know in terms of like quickbooks or a Crm, but just general usage of a computer. So I think that was one of the couple issues that they've had with with

44
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.420
Olivia Vallejo: people that came in as through recruiting and or as a temp.

45
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.230
Olivia Vallejo: Yeah.

46
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.597
Steve Perry: Okay, okay, sounds good.

47
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:25.330
Steve Perry: Well, so I'll tell you, we're we're set up. So our firm has. We've got roughly 40 people on our team. And we're our team is broken up to where we kind of segment out all the recruiting processes. So we look at, you know, we look at recruiting as as a process, right? And so, you know, we've got our team that goes out and finds all the candidates rebuild the list. The outreach team will will do job postings as well. So we're sourcing active and passive candidates.

48
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:47.924
Steve Perry: I have a we have a call center with about a dozen outbound agents in the call center that will reach out to all the passive candidates. They'll schedule, coordinate scheduling with all of our active candidates. And then I have a recruiting management team that actually does the initial interview. So we'll do just like this on Zoom. We'll we'll do a recorded 1st interview.

49
00:06:48.370 --> 00:07:13.229
Steve Perry: that we can, you know. Figure out what what things that you would like to know beforehand before we then take any time of yours to do the rest of your interview process, and then all of our clients get a dedicated customer success manager who oversees the whole project. That's kind of your go to person. So they're they're kind of in between you and our team to to make sure that your

50
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:21.940
Steve Perry: process is is really a white glove as smooth as possible, you know. Kind of like, you know. I know you know, looking at your firm. You look like to be a pretty high end.

51
00:07:22.185 --> 00:07:28.569
Steve Perry: White glove kind of company that really likes our clients to feel like they're getting special treatment. That's kind of the same approach that we work.

52
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:41.600
Steve Perry: Now, one thing I will say is, this is a a little bit outside of our. I know. It seems like really simple. Our tip. Our typical engagements are with firms that have ongoing recruiting needs.

53
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:58.630
Steve Perry: So we do with them. We have a monthly retainer depending on the amount of candidates that they're looking or or hires they're looking to bring in over the years basis. We will put together our proposal for that from time to time.

54
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:17.700
Steve Perry: We do. Obviously, you can expect it, you know, requests like this that are just a 1 off. Hey? We're looking for. This position, this this person and that's really all that we need and so sometimes in those cases. So so that's not our normal bread and butter. But obviously we're set up. But we that would be something we can do.

55
00:08:18.043 --> 00:08:39.700
Steve Perry: We would typically charge a 25% of the 1st year's salary as a placement fee and then would have a a small kind of engagement fee just to, you know. Get our team going on that. And so one of them, you know, one of them is, no matter what the other one is, you know, only based on success.

56
00:08:39.991 --> 00:09:02.138
Steve Perry: The only thing I need to do, Olivia, is I I will need to re visit with my partner just to see you know what our capac teams capacity is to take on kind of a 1 off thing. Everyone's got kind of their process. They follow for our ongoing clients. So I just wanna make sure that that we're good and we can really serve you well with creating just a 1 off.

57
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.450
Olivia Vallejo: Yeah, I think as far as the

58
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:26.170
Olivia Vallejo: the retainer, whatever that that wouldn't be an issue. I think right now, especially speaking with our advisor is finding someone who, of course, we can't guarantee for them to say. But someone who's really interested in and is able to fit in with the company. So yeah, if you reach out with them, and if it's something they can do, I know. He is interested, the advisor, and getting a little bit more information.

59
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:52.569
Steve Perry: Okay, well, that's perfect. Well, I'll put that together then. I'll get back to you. With that to confirm, we can do it, and then kind of an official proposal for you. And then, you know, with your timing, you know, wanting someone to start July first, st I would definitely say it's it's about time to start having these conversations and searching for them now. So but I I appreciate appreciate you hopping on today, and I will. I will get back to you shortly.

60
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.519
Olivia Vallejo: Perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time.

61
00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:19.279
Steve Perry: Absolutely. And one thing I will say, one caveat. I I'm going out of town tonight for for about 10 days, but my other our client, success Manager Megan Sweeney. If I'm not able to connect with my partner and get that figured out first, st you may hear from a Megan I'll be copied on everything. But obviously just I wanna make sure we get back to you in a in a timely and professional manner to if you see that name? That's who that is.

62
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.969
Olivia Vallejo: All right. I appreciate it.

63
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.060
Steve Perry: Thanks, Olivia.

2
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.579
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I think the best way to do that

3
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.760
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: is to give you a 30 second version of what I tell the client.

Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Do that.

13
00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:01.890
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So the title of what I I told my job is is that a financial advisor.

14
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.800
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So come in.

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.219
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: People want to talk to us about

16
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.029
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: any manner of investing.

17
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.400
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Yeah? Or

18
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.859
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: maybe they have a gap in needing life insurance or health insurance.

19
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.049
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: as I was talking about before.

20
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.960
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: to cover the key risk of keeping them on track through retirement.

21
00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:26.139
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: do a couple of different things. It could be very.

22
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.370
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: could be very product focused.

23
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.510
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Okay.

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.649
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: we're both 30. We had, we have 2 children. We just bought a house.

25
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:44.239
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: We really need to get protected in case one of us has something happen. They're sick or hurt. They can't for a couple of years, or or one of them, God forbid! Gets called home.

26
00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:49.350
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: We gotta make life okay for the family. If if somebody dies

27
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.639
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: so it could be something like that.

28
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.209
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: it could be that.

29
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.499
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: You know they've gotta

30
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.140
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: a big 4 0. 1 K, and

31
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.439
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: they're really looking to to retire and transition

32
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.210
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: into turning that into

33
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.879
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: income. And maybe the right type of investment.

34
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.360
Steve Perry: Yup!

35
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.769
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Or it could be. Nope.

36
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.580
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I don't need just

37
00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:15.560
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: a a couple of products. I need a roadmap. I need to make sure that I get from

38
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.990
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: where I am. At the age of 60.

39
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.470
Steve Perry: Yup!

40
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.470
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: To age 90, and that I don't screw this up. I need

41
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.199
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: income tax efficiency. I need.

42
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.770
Steve Perry: Nope.

43
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.920
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Income. I need all that type of thing.

44
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.830
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So there's a lot of different

45
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.010
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: things. We can help people with regarding all those things.

46
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.159
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: We just kind of sit down. Ask the client what their goals are, what they're concerned about, what they're proud about.

47
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.209
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And then we offer advice in a couple of key ways.

48
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:48.580
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: That's a lot for me to take in in my head.

49
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.380
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: plus they have to sit and read. The client read the non verbal cues. See what's going on.

50
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.150
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Then I gotta jot notes

51
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.070
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and they're gonna maneuver things on the computer screen

52
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.300
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and remember where I am in the meeting to come back and summarize at the end and and get them what they need.

53
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.119
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So we have been looking for

54
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.169
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: someone to kind of sit by me that knows

55
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.619
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: our our program, knows how we give advice.

56
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.040
Steve Perry: Doug.

57
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.150
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I can kind of

58
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.560
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: take the cues from the meeting.

59
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.110
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: make notes, and then

60
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.039
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: transition from where

61
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.920
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I've been giving the advice in here

62
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.100
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and put it into the right software.

63
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.699
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Rest of my staff. What forms are necessary when to follow up with the next meeting.

64
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.100
Steve Perry: Yeah.

65
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.869
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: It's kind of like an extension of me to translate

66
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.839
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: to the rest of the staff.

67
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.230
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: make sense.

68
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.679
Steve Perry: Yup, Yup, yup, Yup! And that, and and so what you you mentioned? You've tried a couple of times with that. What didn't work out with that.

69
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.590
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I think that

70
00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:54.325
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: right now.

71
00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.299
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: The front office person does what they do. The office manager, the we have a back end support that, just.

72
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.019
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: you know, doesn't like to sit in front of clients and and be in a sales type role.

73
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.700
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: She takes care of

74
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.230
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: all the forms, the business tracking the.

75
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.260
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: you know, maneuvering of the numbers. So she's just an analyst.

76
00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:17.809
Steve Perry: Yeah.

77
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.660
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Right at it.

78
00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:25.869
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So they cover a lot of roles right now we're trying to pull a few pieces off of both of those.

79
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.469
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: plus what I need.

80
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.670
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and add it to this person.

81
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.009
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And I think that the 1st person

82
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.019
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: that did this, that I think, was really close to making it a career.

83
00:04:37.822 --> 00:04:40.350
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Had severe test. Anxiety.

84
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.699
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Need to have these

85
00:04:43.328 --> 00:04:47.369
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: these tests in order to get the license that you need to do this

86
00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:52.050
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: also, I think they sat idle a little bit from time to time.

87
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.640
Steve Perry: Yup!

88
00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:02.154
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And just like my screw up at the beginning of this call. I'm a little chaotic, and things are all over the place, and they didn't handle that very well.

89
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.070
Steve Perry: Yeah.

90
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.780
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Oh.

91
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.749
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: some of that was that the second person that I got

92
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.619
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: sold themselves very well.

93
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.140
Steve Perry: Yeah.

94
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.999
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Had some unique talents that we needed.

95
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.539
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: but was used to handling

96
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.780
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: like they were a social worker. So they they handled the

97
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.669
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: very bereft and disheveled people, and always me.

98
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:33.910
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: when it came to helping people with money that have demands sometimes a little bit of an attitude like it. So they shut down

99
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.550
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and just quit on us. So

100
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.200
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: those were the 2 swings and misses with this role that we're trying to fill

101
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.529
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and how to make it interesting how to stitch all the pieces together. A very defined system

102
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.109
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: for this, because this type of person is gonna be detail oriented. They're gonna be

103
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.539
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: on schedule. They're gonna be organized.

104
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.370
Steve Perry: You know.

105
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.410
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And I'm not that way.

106
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.130
Steve Perry: Okay.

107
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.059
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I'm the creative innovator, you know the thinking guy.

108
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.230
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: you're welcome.

109
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.119
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and it's kind of like.

110
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.449
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I don't know. I'm not organized.

111
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.240
Steve Perry: Okay?

112
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.640
Steve Perry: And and

113
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.750
Steve Perry: so this associate position, do you need them licensed, or you'll get them licensed.

114
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.890
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Eventually.

115
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:20.563
Steve Perry: Okay. Eventually.

116
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.097
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Do is we give a new candidate the flexibility to see what the job is like.

117
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.830
Steve Perry: Yeah.

118
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.149
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I can do 80% of what they need to do for us anyway, without the licenses.

119
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.730
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So

120
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.260
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: we would build to that.

121
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.710
Steve Perry: Okay.

122
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.920
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: We have 2 people licensed right now.

123
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.630
Steve Perry: Yup!

124
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.249
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: But we would build to that.

125
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:50.119
Steve Perry: And and you're doing your your machine slash you has done is doing all the business development. So it's not a business development role.

126
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.160
Steve Perry: Or is it.

127
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.040
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Can be.

128
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.100
Steve Perry: Can be.

129
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.780
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I gotta wear a lot of hats. So.

130
00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.249
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and because of that, I'm like a squirrel all over the place.

131
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.930
Steve Perry: Sure.

132
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.219
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And there's a lot of things that get

133
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:12.210
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: 70% of the way done depend on my staff to get the other 30. And if this person had a business planning mindset

134
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.219
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: it would help us. It would.

135
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.270
Steve Perry: Okay?

136
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:23.600
Steve Perry: And then the the other position you said is it? Is that an office manager? Is it receptionist? Is it all of those in put together.

137
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.850
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: It's kinda well we could decide whether we want to make this one

138
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.420
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: very, very busy. Full time position.

139
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.010
Steve Perry: Yup!

140
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.380
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Or if we have one, maybe 20 HA week, part time office manager.

141
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.099
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and maybe a 35 to 40 HA week.

142
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.630
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Associate.

143
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.060
Steve Perry: Okay.

144
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.059
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Here's my hand.

145
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.430
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: My front office person.

146
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.610
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: who is

147
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.559
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: in her mid thirties

148
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.639
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: 10 years, is deciding to

149
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.099
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: quit when she can. Okay, bring the new person in.

150
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.950
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: you know, in a step back.

151
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.630
Steve Perry: Okay.

152
00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.410
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: My

153
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:07.630
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: us, my currently non client facing associate who does all the back end work detailed great at it.

154
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.250
Steve Perry: Yup!

155
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.150
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: She's 65 longer. She wants to work, and she.

156
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.760
Steve Perry: True.

157
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.799
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: She's really got some things that pull her away from this grandkids and everything else.

158
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.410
Steve Perry: Yeah.

159
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.340
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I could lose her in a year to be ready to fill that position.

160
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:22.950
Steve Perry: Yup!

161
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:30.042
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So we got a lot of needs. And we just need to get a bunch of really talented people that believe in this practice

162
00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:32.440
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: can pour them into

163
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.260
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: everything needs to get done.

164
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.890
Steve Perry: Okay.

165
00:08:36.397 --> 00:08:39.530
Steve Perry: and you're in. You're in Glenwood right?

166
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.400
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Right.

167
00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:45.389
Steve Perry: And and so and this is. This is an onsite local hire. Both of these.

168
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.590
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Well.

169
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.990
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: that's the thing.

170
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.330
Steve Perry: Okay.

171
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.530
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Virtual could work. But we we do need the person to be.

172
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.780
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: We need the office person to be in the office every day.

173
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:56.400
Steve Perry: Okay.

174
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.999
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: The office manager. The associate

175
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:04.719
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: could be kind of 50 50. It could be 50% virtual, like, we're doing this right now.

176
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.530
Steve Perry: Okay.

177
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.269
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: We have a camera right in our conference room.

178
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.229
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and a big screen that

179
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:15.809
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: is up on the wall just off to my right, or the clients left.

180
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.360
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: They could be listening to the meeting and doing this. Virtually it could be done.

181
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.810
Steve Perry: Okay, okay.

182
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.779
Steve Perry: and how? How long have you

183
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.619
Steve Perry: been building this practice date?

184
00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:30.349
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: This is year 13. It's going into year 14.

185
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.150
Steve Perry: Good for you.

186
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:45.799
Steve Perry: Good for you. Okay. How much of your practice is is you know. Fyc, based versus, you know, recurring assets under management. Financial planning arrangements.

187
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.239
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Tell me more about that. What was that Fyc.

188
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.030
Steve Perry: Or like product sales, you know, for commission based versus versus advisory, based.

189
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.070
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Right now, it's still

190
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.220
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: about 80% product sales and 20% advice that could swing

191
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.989
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: very closely the other way, though to 50 50, because we, too.

192
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.460
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: it tends to be a lot better

193
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.400
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: advice, and you have an even better

194
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.840
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: hold on what the right products are.

195
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.390
Steve Perry: You know.

196
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.019
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: You use the financial planning side.

197
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:18.630
Steve Perry: Right, right.

198
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.340
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So we kind of mock up, especially if somebody.

199
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:27.929
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: it's maybe not the right way to do it. But if somebody's feeling squeamish about paying, a financial planning, fee.

200
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.480
Steve Perry: Yup!

201
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.130
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And I read that

202
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:38.370
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I end up doing partially the planning, anyway, to get the sale because they got 2 million dollars

203
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.220
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: that they want to bring over.

204
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.790
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: That's going to pay 90%

205
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.780
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: of our revenue, anyway.

206
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.450
Steve Perry: Yeah.

207
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.739
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I guess I don't mince words about the other 10%.

208
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:51.850
Steve Perry: Okay?

209
00:10:53.077 --> 00:10:56.809
Steve Perry: And when are you? Are you ready, like now, to hire these positions?

210
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:57.800
Steve Perry: Okay.

211
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.270
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Gonna be pretty dire need.

212
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.159
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: because my office manager wants to leave by the end of the year.

213
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:04.900
Steve Perry: Okay.

214
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.709
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And we were already

215
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.210
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: for the last 2 years

216
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.389
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: trying to hire the other person, and 2 people work out.

217
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:19.499
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So it's pretty dire need within 6 months they'd need to be in the seats, maybe 3.

218
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.410
Steve Perry: Okay.

219
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.850
Steve Perry: And what have you? What have you done in the past to try to recruit these positions?

220
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.289
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Couple of different things. Driving does have a few resources.

221
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:37.350
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: It's not great. It's kind of broken, because all they're focusing on is getting more of me of the full time advisors.

222
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.990
Steve Perry: Right.

223
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.809
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And they know it.

224
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.420
Steve Perry: Yeah.

225
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.900
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: But they're realizing that

226
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.739
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: already established successful practices.

227
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.490
Steve Perry: Yeah.

228
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.870
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Probably give them most of their revenue.

229
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.410
Steve Perry: Yup!

230
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.250
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So

231
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.340
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: they're getting a little bit of help.

232
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.589
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: We did have a kind of a

233
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.650
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: maybe somebody that's like you, Steve, from corporate office

234
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.199
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: do this same thing, learn about our practice expand out.

235
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.260
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: But they ended up putting it on my website

236
00:12:04.945 --> 00:12:10.810
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: an internal thriving website for the job posting. And then I think they put it on. Indeed.

237
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.470
Steve Perry: Okay.

238
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.760
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: We have one candidate in 2 months.

239
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.450
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: They're in the Twin cities

240
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.650
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: fresh to graduate from finance school.

241
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.240
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Yeah, that's not a role

242
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.320
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: like me.

243
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.210
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: not an associate.

244
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:25.820
Steve Perry: Right.

245
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.600
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: That knows people around here.

246
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.220
Steve Perry: Yeah.

247
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.239
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So it didn't

248
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.129
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: net anything.

249
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:32.550
Steve Perry: You know.

250
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.649
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: It did

251
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.310
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: was when we go back and we do a wheeling exercise.

252
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.770
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: we say, Okay, here's our practice.

253
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:40.360
Steve Perry: Yeah.

254
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.660
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Who do we know? Here's our spouses. Here's our family.

255
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.399
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Here's friends that we know, and we wheel outward and start talking to centers of influence.

256
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.040
Steve Perry: Yup!

257
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.399
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Especially my some of my best friends, some of my clients.

258
00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:01.850
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: very close business associates, professional referral basis with like attorneys and accountants.

259
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.639
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: We talked to those people.

260
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:09.809
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and that's how I got all of my current hires, and my best candidates now are coming from them.

261
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.850
Steve Perry: Okay.

262
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.120
Steve Perry: Warm.

263
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.389
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Leads, you know.

264
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:21.769
Steve Perry: Yup, and that's you know, that's typically gonna be the best way. But that only goes so far. And if you you try that and exhaust it. Then, you know, then you gotta go to the next step.

265
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.080
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Yeah, okay.

266
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.850
Steve Perry: Well, good! Well, let me let me just take

267
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.069
Steve Perry: anything else you want to share on that.

268
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.879
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: No, I probably shared more than enough already.

269
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:42.790
Steve Perry: No, that's good, that's good. And so you're ready to hire right away. What are you thinking? Compensation for these people, you know. And you said. You know, it sounds like it's probably 60 to 70 h combined.

270
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.126
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Probably. Yeah. And if it's a if it's a part time position over here.

271
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.629
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: like, just as a basis.

272
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:58.521
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: the person, the 1st person from my associate role that didn't work out is here today filling in for my office manager, Spot.

273
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:03.060
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Weirdly enough, she works at a salon right next to me. That's what she went to do.

274
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.230
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Instead of working with me. Still on good terms, she came back, she says, you know.

275
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.410
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: to do this.

276
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:15.050
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: You used to pay me $22, but since I'm extremely part time, can I have 25.

277
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.670
Steve Perry: Yeah.

278
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.900
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And that's what she needs. Analytical. Maybe

279
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.720
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: it would be somewhere in that neighborhood of

280
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.449
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: anywhere from 20 to $25 an hour for the

281
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.650
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: assistant position for the office assistant.

282
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.100
Steve Perry: Yup!

283
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.410
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: That would mean they have to do a heck of a lot.

284
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:35.070
Steve Perry: Deal.

285
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.329
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: To get that.

286
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:36.930
Steve Perry: Yup!

287
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.238
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: They really gotta dive into the marketing. They gotta do all those things.

288
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.800
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I think.

289
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:50.319
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: and depending on how demanding each of these roles are. If we get the right person, do we gotta pay him more

290
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.610
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Between the 2 of them.

291
00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:00.054
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: I think we can come up with about $75,000 of of salary.

292
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.169
Steve Perry: Sure, sure.

293
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.770
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Yeah.

294
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.300
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And that could go up over time.

295
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.020
Steve Perry: Okay.

296
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.990
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Typically my, my practice does do this and.

297
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:10.890
Steve Perry: Yup!

298
00:15:11.372 --> 00:15:13.299
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: But we will offer

299
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.660
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: a

300
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:20.079
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: small group health dental and vision plan if they'd like it, that can cover their

301
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.240
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: family.

302
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.650
Steve Perry: Yup!

303
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:28.290
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And a simple Ira retirement type plan. There'd be some benefits available.

304
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.730
Steve Perry: Okay, great.

305
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:37.304
Steve Perry: Alright. Let me let me just share a couple a couple of quick slides with you on on who we are.

306
00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:49.171
Steve Perry: so this is our company, the well recruiting solutions, and our mission is to work with advisory firms and able to them to maximize their growth by drawing from the best

307
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:53.038
Steve Perry: You know. We know that most firms

308
00:15:53.690 --> 00:16:17.790
Steve Perry: you know the gap between where they are and where they want to be is probably a talent need that they have. And and so we feel like we wanna. We love helping fill in that talent gap. Our values are excellence, faith, family generosity and growth, and just just a quick background on me. So I spent 17 years at New York Life Insurance Company. So I was an advisor for 5 years

309
00:16:18.135 --> 00:16:25.049
Steve Perry: and then in a leadership position. So I spent many years running firms as a managing partner. We had

310
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:48.979
Steve Perry: about 100 advisors. So recruiting, coaching, developing, helping our experienced advisors grow their practice, you know, helping them bring people into their firm and or their practice, and then, about a little over a year ago I left that position became too corporate. And I you know why you probably started your own practice. In the 1st place. I wanted to own my own business, which is why I got into it in the beginning. And so we really see. I saw a huge need

311
00:16:48.980 --> 00:17:09.019
Steve Perry: in the market for this and so, you know, we work both with the individual firms. We work with independent rias, and then, you know, we would work with, like, you know, whoever your regional director might be that's trying to recruit those new advisors, and and we help them as well. But you know. Got a lot of clients across the Us.

312
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:22.141
Steve Perry: You know, working in metropolitan areas as we're as well as you know, rural areas. You know that. Obviously I'm not telling you anything you don't know. But you know there's only so many people in Glenwood and the surrounding communities, and and so

313
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:29.247
Steve Perry: you know. I I think we're pretty good at finding everybody there is. I can never, you know. I can't say

314
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:45.009
Steve Perry: You know we can always find the perfect person immediately, but if they're out there we will find them, you know, just a few testimonials from our clients, you know. In 5 months the well screened 326 candidates sent us 42. We hired 5 of them.

315
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:59.749
Steve Perry: the well scheduled 56 interviews in 70 days, helping us hire 2 already licensed advisors working with the well is a no-brainer. They brought me back so much time as a managing partner. I didn't even have to hire a recruiting assistant. I get way. Better results at less the cost.

316
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:07.389
Steve Perry: In the last 4 months the well called 2,800 candidates scheduled 260 interviews sent 27 to us, and we hired 2 of them.

317
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.175
Steve Perry: So just a few testimonials.

318
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.110
Steve Perry: I asked you a little bit about your recruiting, you know, one of the things that we find

319
00:18:16.525 --> 00:18:17.540
Steve Perry: is

320
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:36.335
Steve Perry: that building a recruiting team is quite expensive, and most firms don't have the time to do that, you know, they mostly try the job posting, and then maybe they get lucky. Maybe they don't. I'll jump kind of right to the end here. What we do is we? We are this top of the funnel solution. So we will

321
00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:55.330
Steve Perry: take in your what you originally. You know your job job description what you're looking for. Obviously, you know this conversation, and we'll kind of build out an ideal candidate. Profile. We'll use a lot of our different sources, both outbound sources. So we've got a team of

322
00:18:55.330 --> 00:19:09.290
Steve Perry: a dozen outbound interview schedulers full time that make about 3,000 phone calls a day to outbound candidates as well as we'll post, you know, in a lot of different places to get applicants.

323
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:35.990
Steve Perry: We'll do that initial reach out. We'll schedule the screening interviews. We'll conduct the screening interviews to make sure this person isn't going to be a waste of your time. We'll record the interview. Take all the notes, and then the candidates that we think are the best fit for you. Then we will put them on your schedule to complete your recruiting process and so, and then we hand them off to you from there. So

324
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.690
Steve Perry: what what I would say is, if if you would be able to, and I know you got a meeting here in 3 min.

325
00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:49.809
Steve Perry: If you would be able to send us over both of those job descriptions, we can take a a quick look at that.

326
00:19:49.900 --> 00:20:17.890
Steve Perry: and then put together kind of a a proposal for you. Just so, you know the way that we we work with with firms, you know our our practices kind of like yours. We. We operate on kind of a initiation fee, so there'll be, you know, a smaller charge upfront to kind of open up your account to begin the search, to start sourcing candidates, and then we then from there we only charge a success fee on the back end.

327
00:20:18.199 --> 00:20:35.540
Steve Perry: Based on. You know what your final offer is to them. It's a percentage of their annualized earnings, and then that's due upon them, successfully accepting that offer, and we also offer a guarantee on the back end, you know, if they, if they leave before a certain amount of months is done we'll replace them

328
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.670
Steve Perry: for free as well. So

329
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.719
Steve Perry: if you want to send those job descriptions over to me.

330
00:20:42.062 --> 00:20:53.329
Steve Perry: Dean, and I'll get that to Megan. We'll we'll we'll put together a proposal for you. Hop on another quick call, and then we'll go over that with you, and then you can let us know if if that sounds good.

331
00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:00.850
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Okay, sounds good. So not tied into anything until we look at your proposal. Have that call, and then we make the decision.

332
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:14.530
Steve Perry: Correct. Yep, yeah, no, yeah, no. So next call again would be just going over that proposal. If you do want to proceed there again, there is. There's an initiation fee, but most of the cost is only after a successful successful placement.

333
00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.510
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Sounds good. Let's do it.

334
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:28.629
Steve Perry: Alright awesome so send that when we get that from you. We'll put that together. I'll reply, with another quick scheduling link. You can find a quick, quick time that we can hop on, maybe early next week, and we'll go from there.

335
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.151
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Yeah, and I'll beg your forgiveness.

336
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.409
Steve Perry: Worry about it.

337
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.570
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Through the through the crazy of this.

338
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.859
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: If I don't respond the 1st time hit me up again.

339
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.520
Steve Perry: Okay.

340
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.245
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: And we'll get it done.

341
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.280
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: But if you got 10 seconds this story is just too good.

342
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.059
Steve Perry: Yeah, let me hear it.

343
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.200

Steve Perry: Yeah, yeah.

350
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:04.669
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: But then, on top of that, the next guy that I'm seeing his last name is Miller.

351
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.349
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: Thinking, I got all this rock and roll confused in my head.

352
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.130
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: So I'm thinking, okay, Steve Miller.

353

Steve Perry: I love it.

355
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.239
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: 9 in the morning, on top of the fact that

356
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.900
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: they were both sourced by a scout.

357
00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.230
Steve Perry: That's amazing.

358
00:22:24.492 --> 00:22:25.280
Dane Ankeny - Minnewaska: For a Friday.

359
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.159

1
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.009
Steve Perry: Can you hear me?

2
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.010
Matthew Tooley: Now we're good.

3
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.820
Matthew Tooley: All right.

4
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.261
Matthew Tooley: Yeah. I don't know why

5
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.150
Matthew Tooley: we use calendly all the time also. So I've never had

6
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.730
Matthew Tooley: an issue with not receiving a meeting through it, so.

7
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.030
Steve Perry: If it's not, if it doesn't show up in your calendar, there's no way to know it's there, so don't.

8
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.371
Matthew Tooley: Yeah, I mean, it didn't show up on my emails, either. So I don't know what

9
00:00:56.726 --> 00:01:02.680
Matthew Tooley: I even check. I have a little folder separated out because we have so many

10
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.870
Matthew Tooley: notifications from commonly I have them all go in there. But yeah, no, it's sorry about that. So.

11
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.860
Steve Perry: Oh, that's okay. Well, Super, super nice to meet you.

12
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.970
Matthew Tooley: Yeah. Pleasure.

13
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.300
Steve Perry: Are you? Are you in Missouri?

14
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.300
Matthew Tooley: Yeah. Saint Louis.

15
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.999
Steve Perry: Okay, like I was, I saw that I was looking on your website and like, I couldn't quite figure out, do you guys, do you guys, are you all remote? Or do you guys have an office or.

16
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:38.613
Matthew Tooley: Remote currently. Eventually, we like to get an office. But we started in 2020 during the pandemic. So I was at Northwestern mutual for 12 years before that. And then

17
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:48.231
Matthew Tooley: my 2 partners, they're both in Academia. So one's at a professor at Saint Louis University, another one's professor at Kansas State University. So,

18
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.480
Matthew Tooley: yeah.

19
00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:02.680
Steve Perry: Okay, awesome. I was and I was doing a little bit of snooping, and it look looks like you. You got almost what 7 800 million in aum already.

20
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.809
Matthew Tooley: No, that's not us. That's our, that's our our Ria. So there's 25 5 advisors associated with it.

21
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.330
Steve Perry: Gotcha.

22
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.210
Matthew Tooley: So.

23
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.800
Steve Perry: Gotcha.

24
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.270
Matthew Tooley: So they have. So we're associated with lotsorum advisors. They're out of Overland Park.

25
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.340
Matthew Tooley: And then so we started.

26
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:32.810
Matthew Tooley: I mean, we always get called by everyone right? So when you're in in the industry. So Td. Ameritrade reached out to me, and probably like 2016 or something.

27
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:53.640
Matthew Tooley: and told me, why don't you start your own ria? I was like, well, you make it sound a lot easier than what I know it to be so, but I was like I would I wouldn't mind. And at the size of the Aum that we're at and definitely back. Then I was like, you know, I would like to probably be better choice to plug in somewhere. That gives us the latitude to

28
00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.120
Matthew Tooley: market, how we want to market manage our portfolios technology, but then shoulder compliance and help us with some back office. So.

29
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.870
Steve Perry: Yeah.

30
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.720
Matthew Tooley: And then so yeah. So we jumped on with Lexorum.

31
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.160
Matthew Tooley: And then here we just hired advisor down in Austin, Texas.

32
00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:16.620
Matthew Tooley: Who was Thomas's buddy that wanted to get out of corporate world. So he's like a fresh.

33
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.130
Matthew Tooley: like fresh meat in the industry.

34
00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:26.539
Matthew Tooley: And we're looking to possibly bring on an intern here soon. So, but yeah.

35
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.400
Steve Perry: Okay. So right now, we're working on redoing our website and relaunching.

36
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.089
Matthew Tooley: Kind of like client experience, and all that. So.

37
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.479
Steve Perry: Okay, and you were at. You were at Northwestern for 12 years.

38
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.445
Matthew Tooley: Yeah.

39
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.660
Steve Perry: Did it?

40
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.459
Steve Perry: Is that long enough to vest your your renewals.

41
00:03:47.113 --> 00:03:51.030
Matthew Tooley: I had 7 years vesting.

42
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.799
Matthew Tooley: Let's see here how many? I think it was 7 years vested.

43
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.730
Steve Perry: Okay.

44
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.580
Matthew Tooley: So.

45
00:03:56.091 --> 00:04:05.440
Matthew Tooley: Yes, you have to be there 15 years to be fully vested for the full 10 years of renewals, but I still get a a small paycheck from them.

46
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.460
Steve Perry: Gotcha.

47
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.250
Matthew Tooley: But yeah, and then all the assets or large majority of the assets transferred over.

48
00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:15.330
Matthew Tooley: So I think I retained probably

49
00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.219
Matthew Tooley: at least 80%, maybe a little bit more.

50
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.090
Matthew Tooley: Of the assets that came over.

51
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.319
Steve Perry: So, and then also, like some of the.

52
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.030
Matthew Tooley: I've seen other advisors like Northwester meet. You do a lot of joint work right with other advisors.

53
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.889
Matthew Tooley: and they always rub me the wrong way. When a bigger advisor would leave, they would take the the clients

54
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:51.960
Matthew Tooley: so like I didn't take any clients that was from a younger advisor that brought me in right if if I brought an older advisor and I was like, that's my client. I brought them to you. I'm taking them out, but

55
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:59.720
Matthew Tooley: you know it's kind of bullshit when I've had that happen to me where older advisor leaves, and then they take the client and you're like, and they don't pay you for it, and it's like.

56
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.299
Steve Perry: Yeah, okay.

57
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.910
Matthew Tooley: So.

58
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.289
Steve Perry: Yeah, what was.

59
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.150
Matthew Tooley: Oh, yeah.

60
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.400
Steve Perry: What was your your impetus to finally going out on your own.

61
00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:13.300
Matthew Tooley: It was more on the investment management side of things.

62
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.029
Matthew Tooley: So you know, they were changing.

63
00:05:19.762 --> 00:05:30.569
Matthew Tooley: Well, one, there's always some sort of corporate mandate, right? So northwestern Mutual. It's so much of your revenue needs to be from insurance products or their core products.

64
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.960
Steve Perry: Yup!

65
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.589
Matthew Tooley: and then which, once you take care of a lot of the insurance, you know the insurance need.

66
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.570
Steve Perry: Yeah.

67
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.880
Matthew Tooley: Decreases. So it means you're always need to bring in new clients or something, or always trying to get them convert some of their term to permanent

68
00:05:46.398 --> 00:05:55.620
Matthew Tooley: but the thing that really got me to move over was, they said that they want to stabilize the investment grid because advisors were complaining.

69
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.699
Matthew Tooley: and I was like, What do you like? They need certain amount of revenue

70
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.189
Matthew Tooley: from one pocket or the other pocket. So they were complaining that

71
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.740
Matthew Tooley: advisors, I guess advisors are complaining. Probably new advisors were complaining that, like the grid, increased every year.

72
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.800
Matthew Tooley: but it only increased by like 3 or 4%, so literally

73
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.909
Matthew Tooley: like, as long as you weren't losing assets you generally weren't going to move down

74
00:06:23.812 --> 00:06:26.287
Matthew Tooley: but that was the issue with

75
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.400
Matthew Tooley: So they then they said they were going to stabilize it. So an advisory. What they do is they have a program fee.

76
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.199
Matthew Tooley: and the program fee was like a minimum of

77
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.110
Matthew Tooley: either 2, 50, or 2, 75, and I think it it capped at some certain amount. And it was.

78
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.250
Matthew Tooley: There's either I forget if it's like 7% or 7 bips or something like that. But anyways

79
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.059
Matthew Tooley: they switched it. So all advisory counts. The minimum program fee was 500 bucks.

80
00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.420
Matthew Tooley: And so Northwestern Mutual. They're advisory. Fee

81
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:16.199
Matthew Tooley: was pretty set. You could discount up to a certain amount, but once you discount past it, Northwestern Mutuals is like, well, that's great that you're discounting them. But we're gonna take our portion out of your side of the equation to make up for that deeper discount.

82
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.720
Steve Perry: Yeah.

83
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.740
Matthew Tooley: So that was the thing like.

84
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:30.969
Matthew Tooley: you know that that. And then just the dol where they're like, Okay, now we're gonna do this, and then they took it back. And now they're sounds like it's probably coming back. And all this

85
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.470
Matthew Tooley: it was just a very

86
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:59.590
Matthew Tooley: I don't know. I was getting headaches explained to clients like to me. It didn't make sense where you had like a larger account, you know, where it's like a million dollars. And then they had like a roth, Ira, like 50,000 like, we're gonna have to use a shares or C shares for this. And you know, because it's smaller. Then, once it grows, then we bring it over. But since we use a shares, you have to wait for a 3 year waiting period before you can slowly start transferring. I was like, this is just

87
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.180
Matthew Tooley: ridiculous. So we're able to move.

88
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.859
Matthew Tooley: And we were charging the clients like 20 to 30% less.

89
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.240
Matthew Tooley: but making 200% more in revenue.

90
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.679
Matthew Tooley: So now our expenses are more.

91
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:18.010
Matthew Tooley: But we have that independence, you know, and we don't go into meetings with any sort of

92
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.769
Matthew Tooley: preconceived notion of like this is a need or whatnot, so.

93
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.020
Steve Perry: How do I find the how do I find the insurance need.

94
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.399
Matthew Tooley: Yeah, exactly. Or even I was talking to like Wells Fargo guys. And

95
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:37.689
Matthew Tooley: you know, and they're like they were telling us how many that we need to sell this many mortgages we're like, we don't do mortgages. So.

96
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.289
Steve Perry: Right.

97
00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:51.039
Matthew Tooley: Like. So I feel like any corporate you know, any corporate setting or corporate Ri, or anything like there, there's gonna be some sort of mandate that gets pushed down, and it's gonna tug at your, you know.

98
00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:55.809
Matthew Tooley: like, is this truly in the best interest, or, you know, stuff like that. So.

99
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:56.490
Steve Perry: Yeah.

100
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.680
Matthew Tooley: But so that was a big reason I left.

101
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.650
Steve Perry: How is your relationship with your Ga.

102
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:08.220
Matthew Tooley: Oh, very good like I mean they handed me what they could for my Crm. When I left.

103
00:09:09.122 --> 00:09:13.948
Matthew Tooley: I still wish him happy birthday, and you know, stuff like that. And

104
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:20.114
Matthew Tooley: there's no you know there's nothing bad about that.

105
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:29.280
Matthew Tooley: you know. The other big reason I left was. I see that there's a huge flood of you know. You have all the baby boomers retiring.

106
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:35.340
Matthew Tooley: and so there's a tidal wave on that standpoint. But then the other side of it is.

107
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.360
Matthew Tooley: the average advisor is like 58 years old.

108
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.839
Matthew Tooley: There's gonna be a huge tidal wave of advisors retiring.

109
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.460
Steve Perry: So.

110
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:53.169
Matthew Tooley: And I never at Northwestern Mutual saw an advisor that was outside a big, successful advisor outside Northwestern Mutual come into Northwestern Mutual.

111
00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:03.709
Matthew Tooley: I've seen a bunch of successful advisors leave the other way. But I've never seen one come in. So my thought process is, if we could build this team and acquire practice.

112
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:20.950
Matthew Tooley: It would have to be in the end. We would have to be an independent space to make that work that way. We can deal with their models, and, like, I know, from Northwestern Mutual Side, they're like, well, you can bring it in, and then we'll give you so a certain timeframe in order to get into asset allocation.

113
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:21.669
Steve Perry: Yeah, yeah.

114
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.660
Matthew Tooley: But it doesn't work with non qualified accounts. So

115
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.494
Matthew Tooley: you know, some of those pieces were things that

116
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.031
Matthew Tooley: that was another big reason for the

117
00:10:34.045 --> 00:10:43.209
Matthew Tooley: move is we wanted to not cause we were at the perfect age, and still are like, we're, you know, we're. I guess I was 38 when we moved.

118
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.669
Matthew Tooley: Yeah, 38 when we moved, went independent.

119
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.819
Matthew Tooley: And we had. You know, we're 40. I'm 42 now. So we still have 20 to 25 years

120
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:59.410
Matthew Tooley: time horizon, so plenty of time to acquire practice, so.

121
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.270
Steve Perry: Yeah.

122
00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.379
Matthew Tooley: And great.

123
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.400
Steve Perry: Good for you. Good for you. How's how's it been going.

124
00:11:07.413 --> 00:11:18.226
Matthew Tooley: I mean it's ups and downs, but I do it again. So I mean, for the most part, I'd say it's pretty good. We're this Rebrand, where I'm kind of done with, and I'm ready to for it to roll

125
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.700
Matthew Tooley: And then, you know, I mean 2022 was a little rough there. So

126
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.410
Matthew Tooley: but yeah, I mean the good, the pros and cons is.

127
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:32.990
Matthew Tooley: the advantage is you can use whatever technology out there that you want right? And we don't have much constraints there.

128
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.469
Matthew Tooley: The disadvantage is, we can use whatever technology we want out there. So we're like

129
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:46.860
Matthew Tooley: sifting through stuff where, you know, there is something nice about just being like. Here's the here it is. Go out there and use it right? So.

130
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:47.620
Steve Perry: Yeah.

131
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.719
Matthew Tooley: So, yeah, so that

132
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:56.640
Matthew Tooley: I think the biggest thing, if I had to go back was to have a better feel for the Crm system that we want to go with. And

133
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:03.479
Matthew Tooley: I think that was created a much smoother process over the long call. So.

134
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.970
Steve Perry: What did you guys land on.

135
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:18.410
Matthew Tooley: Right now we're at Lintica. Using cylintica. They have 2 products. They have a salesforce product. And then they have a Microsoft engage product. And we're using the salesforce product, which

136
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:25.950
Matthew Tooley: I'm not a huge salesforce fan, we'll see. But advisor down Texas that we brought on.

137
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.369
Matthew Tooley: He's used salesforce a lot more. So I think he's gonna be able to help us.

138
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.529
Matthew Tooley: maybe use it more efficiently and stuff like that. So

139
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.030
Matthew Tooley: we use Microsoft at North Russian Mutual. So.

140
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.420
Steve Perry: And.

141
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.440
Matthew Tooley: But they had it, I mean.

142
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.964
Matthew Tooley: they also put a shit ton of money into it so they could customize it. However, they wanted to.

143
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.850
Matthew Tooley: and it was like one of those things that after you left

144
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:56.909
Matthew Tooley: you're like man that was really nice that I had that wish. I wish I could bring that piece along with me, and then, even then, you know, now I meet with

145
00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:03.880
Matthew Tooley: my Northwestern Mutual advisor that's managing my insurance accounts, and he'll show me like the app. And I'm like.

146
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.229
Matthew Tooley: I was like, Yeah, that is, that's nice.

147
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.982
Steve Perry: So, yeah, I know I hear you.

148
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:22.139
Steve Perry: I know. If us building out our our tech stack, I I just built a slide that put like all the Logos. And we're like, I don't know. 2528 different tech stack vendors that we use. Just.

149
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.040
Steve Perry: you know.

150
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.390
Steve Perry: Yeah.

151
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.399
Steve Perry: So it's that is, that's real.

152
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.450
Steve Perry: How can I invent that?

153
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.980
Steve Perry: Yeah.

154
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:39.999
Matthew Tooley: So, yeah, and so. And you know, if the 1st time we went with salesforce, I was oversold because we went with salesforce financial cloud financial services cloud

155
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.920
Matthew Tooley: directly from Salesforce.

156
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:52.270
Matthew Tooley: and they sold it as if it was like a plugin like ready to go. And it's like, no, it's like a box of components that you have to figure out how to configure. I'm like

157
00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:07.560
Matthew Tooley: as much as interesting as this is to me. That's just. I don't have the time to do that like, and that's not what my clients want me to do is figure out how to manage salesforce. So yeah, so that's why we went with this Lentika to help us

158
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:13.400
Matthew Tooley: with that, and we'll see after I think we have 2 more years. We might switch to like a wealth box, or something

159
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.120
Matthew Tooley: something like that. So who knows?

160
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.510
Steve Perry: And tell me about your team.

161
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.180
Matthew Tooley: So it's so, Thomas.

162
00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:32.360
Matthew Tooley: He has his his doctorates in finance and subwie. They both had their doctorates in finance. They got their Phds down at University of Florida.

163
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:38.710
Matthew Tooley: and one of my good buddies from college finished up his residency in Michigan.

164
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:45.069
Matthew Tooley: came down here. Him and Thomas grew up together. So that's how Thomas and I got connected in 2012,

165
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:56.010
Matthew Tooley: and then just playing volleyball, softball, fancy baseball, and all that. About 2018, I approached on. Why don't we look at starting our own independent firm?

166
00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.100
Matthew Tooley: I don't know of another firm that has Phds helping to manage clients, portfolios?

167
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:08.899
Matthew Tooley: And yeah, after a little convincing low time and all that. Then we built it out.

168
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:22.519
Matthew Tooley: and then, my assistant from Northwestern Mutual came over Kristen. So so there's us 4. And then Thomas wanted to be not just in the closet crunching numbers. He wanted to be client facing also.

169
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.890
Matthew Tooley: So he brought on his Buddy Sabui.

170
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:32.220
Matthew Tooley: who's a professor at Kane State University. He's the director of financial analysis over there.

171
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.549
Matthew Tooley: So as a team, it's us, you know it. It's us.

172
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:44.920
Matthew Tooley: So what we've been, what we've been needing to do better is, you know, get to the point where now we're out there, growing our practice

173
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.430
Matthew Tooley: more aggressively than what we've been so

174
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:56.029
Matthew Tooley: and part of that was, you know, right when we 1st started, there's been 2 2 advisors that we've almost acquired

175
00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:02.149
Matthew Tooley: one. The guy reached out to us like literally a month after we rolled out, and he was interested.

176
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:11.240
Matthew Tooley: and he pulled out 2 weeks from us, closing with the bank on the loan, and he used Biden's.

177
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:21.440
Matthew Tooley: His fear of Biden going to increase cap gains to normal income and all that stuff. Anyways, he got cold feet backed out

178
00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:25.520
Matthew Tooley: that would have been a nice practice. And then we had. So we

179
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:32.510
Matthew Tooley: that we spent way too much time on, probably like 6 months a lot of learning, you know what what not to do.

180
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:42.320
Matthew Tooley: And then the other advisor we've been talking to had stage 4 colon cancer but he's at cetera.

181
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:50.119
Matthew Tooley: and just the thought of moving his practice over here is overwhelming to him, based on its health.

182
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.989
Matthew Tooley: So even though we're gonna pay, you know, pay for it, and he would have little. He would just have to

183
00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.270
Matthew Tooley: be the face or a little bit so.

184
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:00.950
Steve Perry: Yeah.

185
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.419
Matthew Tooley: But yeah, so that's where kind of where we've been.

186
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:14.180
Steve Perry: And so so that is, is that your primary growth strategy? Or you guys are thinking, you know, now.

187
00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:17.090
Steve Perry: like prospecting some more or both.

188
00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:33.709
Matthew Tooley: Both. So when we 1st moved it out, rolled out. My thought process was a 3 prong approach on growth. One was just organic growth referrals us, filling out being our own clients. Secondly, was

189
00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:42.489
Matthew Tooley: acquiring practices, and the 3rd one potentially was once we built our process, and all that.

190
00:17:42.769 --> 00:17:59.069
Matthew Tooley: allowing other advisors to tap in to what we have in the team, and saying that they they, you know that they have Phd. Helping them with their portfolios and stuff like that. So so that was the 3 main growth strategies.

191
00:17:59.139 --> 00:18:05.619
Matthew Tooley: I think, after the the 2 advisors, we're focusing more on the organic growth, and then maybe

192
00:18:05.809 --> 00:18:12.009
Matthew Tooley: a client advisor you know, plugging in, if

193
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:19.059
Matthew Tooley: if and when that ever makes sense. But we're not like we haven't been actively hunting for advisors in that space.

194
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.251
Steve Perry: Got it? Got it? Okay, okay.

195
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.020
Matthew Tooley: So what do you guys do.

196
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:42.471
Steve Perry: Yeah, good for you. So I so I spent 17 years at New York life. Alright. So I was. I was an advisor for 5 years, and then, you know, managing partner, for you know. So I was the Ga. For 7, 8 years

197
00:18:42.830 --> 00:19:08.330
Steve Perry: and just left last year. To. So we we do recruiting for both, for, like you know, the managing partner gas who are recruiting the new reps. We work with, you know, larger independent raas and kind of act as their in house recruiting team, for you know, whatever whatever they're looking to fill and then we.

198
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.451
Steve Perry: you know. So a small little niche that

199
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:30.235
Steve Perry: we found is, you know, a lot of like solopreneurs or small teams are like they need one off. They're like, Hey, I need a Afa. I need a you know. I need an office manager. I need an assistant, and you know most. You know they're like I've I've done all the job postings. I've done the Linkedin jobs. I've done all that like. Just give me somebody

200
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:36.333
Steve Perry: that is good. And so, you know, that's that's kind of the 3rd 3rd thing we serve there. So

201
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:57.126
Steve Perry: right now, yeah. So right now, we're we're recruiting solution for people in the in the financial advisory wealth management, space. That, you know, have have talent needs and you know, we started started kind of with those 1st 2 niches. And and so we're we're growing out our own own sales team now. So we've got,

202
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:24.939
Steve Perry: you know, 38 people on our team overall. I got a call center recruiting managers, operations, all that. And and now last piece is sales. So you know, just having having lots of conversations with people that fall into one of those 3 niches, and you know, just say, like, Hey, we're here to be. We're here to be a resource for you if and if and when the time comes that that you have talent needs, or you know, if you're any study groups that you know, guy with guys and gals that that have those.

203
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:30.780
Steve Perry: yeah, we've got the experience in that spot. And that's what we do. So

204
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.630
Steve Perry: the so the 30 second commercial of it.

205
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.730
Matthew Tooley: Yeah, okay.

206
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:36.340
Steve Perry: So.

207
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:47.129
Matthew Tooley: Yeah. So then, do you? Yeah. Cause I mean, we're the nice thing about let's arm advisors, and you might want to reach out to them. I don't know if they're like

208
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.490
Matthew Tooley: hunting for advisors.

209
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:55.590
Matthew Tooley: I don't know how aggressively they're hunting for advisors also, but, like

210
00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:02.530
Matthew Tooley: you know, there there are a bunch of independent advisors in there, and that was one thing that was attractive about it was.

211
00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:10.730
Matthew Tooley: and it wasn't a corporate ria structure to us was one of the attractions to me.

212
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.158
Matthew Tooley: But yeah, I mean, I think,

213
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:19.580
Matthew Tooley: do you guys also do with like succession planning like, do you run across that much at all?

214
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.949
Steve Perry: Everybody wants us to help with that.

215
00:21:23.487 --> 00:21:34.070
Steve Perry: Yeah, our, our. We've tried a few. Really, the only place that we found we can be effective in that is is more of the

216
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:41.649
Steve Perry: you know, the the independent rias that have the internal sales team, and you know they're building their own book.

217
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:48.940
Steve Perry: We'll we'll bring advisors in to be the the closer or the servicing advisor and and those things. But

218
00:21:49.380 --> 00:22:11.339
Steve Perry: It's you know, that that's a really high touch game, I mean a, as you know, and we're we're we're more built for speed and having a lot of conversations instead of a few, you know high quality, you know. Like, when you were leaving, I'm sure you had a lot of conversations. And you know, that's someone you gotta trust you. Gotta. You know you. They gotta know what they're talking about, and we just don't have that infrastructure right now.

219
00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:12.460
Matthew Tooley: Gotcha.

220
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.879
Matthew Tooley: Yeah, I mean, I think you know kind of from our

221
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:22.240
Matthew Tooley: mindset when we were rolling over from Northwestern Mutual was, you know, we have some.

222
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:31.079
Matthew Tooley: We definitely have some households that are not our ideal client. Right? There are clients that were brought in from a younger advisor that

223
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.489
Matthew Tooley: didn't make it or all that. So I was the their advisor.

224
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.490
Matthew Tooley: And when we left I didn't want to say, Okay, just, you know.

225
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:52.379
Matthew Tooley: stay there. Good luck. Hopefully they assign you someone good, right? You know, if they wanted to come, we weren't gonna say no to them coming, even though they not really ideal my mind. My mindset with that was.

226
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:59.259
Matthew Tooley: you know, as we grow, we can always bring in a junior advisor to service. Those clients like, you know.

227
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:19.319
Matthew Tooley: abundance shouldn't be an issue. There's always younger advisors and people that want to get in the practice that the hardest parts is finding clients right? A lot of people find the idea of being a financial advisor very attractive. But then they find out that you need clients to advise, and they're usually not just handed to you

228
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:31.679
Matthew Tooley: so. But so that's where my mindset was with our clientele is, you know, we don't have a minimum at this stage on assets and all that, even though we do kind of

229
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.690
Matthew Tooley: target more half 1 million and above

230
00:23:35.364 --> 00:23:39.510
Matthew Tooley: we're fine with bringing on people with the mindset of.

231
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.309
Matthew Tooley: And I even let them know, like I may not be your main point of contact in the long run.

232
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.689
Matthew Tooley: We're still, we manage investments and all that as a firm

233
00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:51.549
Matthew Tooley: but yeah, so you know. So that's kind of I

234
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.960
Matthew Tooley: mindset there is that as we grow we'd have

235
00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:02.880
Matthew Tooley: you know, these clients that aren't ideal for us. That would be ideal for someone. So.

236
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:22.620
Steve Perry: I think that's super. I think that's super smart, and I think there's, you know, a lot of I mean, you know how hard it is to build from scratch. And so you know you, you bring someone in newer in the business, you know A, you build your succession plan and and B, you get you give them stuff, but you get the delta on it.

237
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:29.730
Matthew Tooley: Yeah, exactly. And so. And then the you know the mindset of like bringing on advisors.

238
00:24:30.494 --> 00:24:36.350
Matthew Tooley: And you're right. The succession plan is hard like just a

239
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:46.689
Matthew Tooley: get over the mindset of moving and having that conversation with clients is a huge mindset on it, especially if it's transitioning from one firm to another firm.

240
00:24:47.261 --> 00:24:51.800
Matthew Tooley: And then just a mindset of retiring. Right?

241
00:24:51.860 --> 00:25:01.360
Matthew Tooley: And I think that's a mindset that a lot of these advisors have. They've been working their entire lives. And they're like, why would I leave now when I'm making the most money I ever have in my career?

242
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.790
Matthew Tooley: And it's kind of like that, you know the carrot on the string. It's always going to be there. You're

243
00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.260
Matthew Tooley: ideally

244
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:15.369
Matthew Tooley: in this industry. You're always telling me making more the next year, because the markets just go up over the long run. So, but finding, you know.

245
00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.950
Matthew Tooley: we'd definitely be interested in like finding those older clients older advisors that want to

246
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:32.809
Matthew Tooley: plug in and have a team. Help them with the servicing. Still staying like you said. Be the closer in the face of it, but take away some of the pieces that they don't like to do

247
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:40.210
Matthew Tooley: with the end goal of that they would be like, yes, I'm on at some point. I would just sell my practice to you guys. So.

248
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.659
Steve Perry: Yeah. But yeah, yeah, that's good.

249
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.340
Matthew Tooley: So.

250
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.230
Steve Perry: Okay.

251
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.280
Steve Perry: Well, good man. Well.

252
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.789
Matthew Tooley: How do you guys work on like a retainer? A percentage of like when you bring on advisors

253
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.270
Matthew Tooley: and stuff like that.

254
00:25:53.270 --> 00:26:06.159
Steve Perry: Yeah. So so the kind of those 3 models, right? But you know, with the the Ga. Vp that's constantly recruiting, you know, they pay us a monthly fee, depending on how many candidates they want us to interview for them.

255
00:26:06.603 --> 00:26:15.986
Steve Perry: That where we come in as a, as a in house recruiting team. We have a, you know, a small monthly retainer, and then a success fee. And then

256
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:29.870
Steve Perry: on the on the one off. It's just it's a it's a what we call an engaged agreement. So there's a, you know, small upfront for us to start. And then most of it's a success fee on the back end, as a percentage of, you know, 1st year Comp.

257
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:31.820
Matthew Tooley: Gotcha.

258
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:32.620
Matthew Tooley: Alright.

259
00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:49.630
Matthew Tooley: So I seem like the Ga. And that model and the the monthly retainer, the smaller like those are probably just brand new people to the industry. Right? They don't really have a book of business.

260
00:26:49.970 --> 00:27:08.089
Steve Perry: Career changers. So so not, you know not. College interns are. It's typically the 30 to 45 year old, you know, operations manager. GM, you know, sales, Guy, you know, mortgage broker, that that kind of person. So again, not

261
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:17.650
Steve Perry: not not the intern classes that you were used to seeing come in and Northwestern Mutual. But not not people that have a on already built book of business.

262
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.469
Matthew Tooley: Yeah, yeah, I was a career changer when I went into Northwestern Mutual. So.

263
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.920
Steve Perry: There you go!

264
00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:31.589
Matthew Tooley: Not the internship program. But yeah, I understand the 9,000 interns that Northwestern Mutual has per year. So.

265
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.320
Steve Perry: Yup!

266
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.330
Matthew Tooley: Alright.

267
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.660
Matthew Tooley: Okay.

268
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.139
Matthew Tooley: Well, yeah, I mean, I think you know.

269
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.950
Matthew Tooley: at this stage I'm not sure we have much.

270
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.820
Steve Perry: Yeah.

271
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:49.339
Matthew Tooley: Need for it, but hopefully down the road as we grow we will have more of that need and and stuff like that. So.

272
00:27:49.340 --> 00:28:01.356
Steve Perry: Absolutely no. And I mean, just like you, right? We're we're sharing the story of our business. And you know, I I get your world. I was in it, and and coached it and helped people build it for years. So

273
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.468
Steve Perry: I I respect what you're doing.

274
00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:22.100
Steve Perry: I respect what you're doing. I mean, I've got. I have several Northwestern mutual friends we've, you know, Northwestern mutual clients. And so it's you know, and then some that have left, and and, you know, gone independent and and done other things. So I'm I'm it's impressive what you're doing.

275
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:23.990
Matthew Tooley: Yeah.

276
00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:30.193
Matthew Tooley: Oh, hopefully, in a year or 2 it'll be even more impressive. So.

277
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:31.060
Steve Perry: I love it.

278
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.070
Matthew Tooley: So, yeah, but.

279
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:39.659
Steve Perry: So I would be remiss. I mean, are you in any study groups? You got any of your guys like man? I need to hire somebody I like. I've been looking you ever have that.

280
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.449
Matthew Tooley: So we we haven't. We really haven't had that

281
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:50.479
Matthew Tooley: conversation too much. We are in a study group. So there's 25 advisors

282
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.910
Matthew Tooley: in our Ria, and there's about

283
00:28:54.310 --> 00:29:07.960
Matthew Tooley: we do a monthly study group study, guide group with advisors. So one thing that RI. Does is like they don't like post. They don't do like production like a lot of the advisors in RA.

284
00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:08.930
Matthew Tooley: Like.

285
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:14.309
Matthew Tooley: Probably a 3rd of them are Cpas. They have accounting practices, too, so it's a very

286
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:19.550
Matthew Tooley: eclectic group of advisors, which is nothing I like versus like

287
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.929
Matthew Tooley: when you're at Northwestern Mutual or New York life, or.

288
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:28.440
Steve Perry: Ever. Jones, you get that group think going. Everyone has the same thoughts. All that where.

289
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.890
Matthew Tooley: When you have people coming from different perspectives, you get

290
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:45.169
Matthew Tooley: more genuine ideas. I would say, but yeah, I can definitely bring it up and talk to someone like I know another advisor that runs a fairly bigger internship program out of Ohio.

291
00:29:45.753 --> 00:29:51.390
Matthew Tooley: And there's might be a couple another advisor that brought on a young

292
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:57.510
Matthew Tooley: guy that just just passed the Cpa. He's bringing them on to kind of help with more

293
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.120
Matthew Tooley: building out a tax department within his practice, too.

294
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:12.240
Matthew Tooley: So I mean there might be some that would be looking for a, you know.

295
00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:17.469
Matthew Tooley: Fresh meat per se. That's hungry for sales and stuff like that and

296
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.029
Matthew Tooley: get in there. But we haven't really brought that topic up much.

297
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:31.609
Steve Perry: Yeah, and that's not your, that's not your focus. But you know, I know I know you being in this. You you always like to help people if they, if they come to you with something. So I'd just love to be that resource.

298
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.540
Steve Perry: although I don't know how to get a hold of me, because apparently my emails can't get through to you.

299
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.710
Matthew Tooley: Yeah, I don't know what you have, Matt at e right e wealth group e, as in echo.

Steve,

It was great talking with you.

Attached is our Firm Overview deck and Acquisition/Recruiting guide.

Our standard arrangement is as follows:

""The service fee by candidate is outlined as follows. If the Candidate is salaried (W2), the fee is based upon 25% of the employee’s first year’s estimated gross earnings. If the Candidate is on a commission structure (K1 or 1099), the fee is based upon 6% of the Candidate’s year 1 gross production. 3% (of the 6%) of the estimated year 1 gross production is paid as an immediate service fee. At the end of the first year, an additional 3% on actual year 1 gross production is paid. If the “trueing up” figure is less than the 3% paid out initially, then no fee is due.""

As we discussed, feel free to keep an eye on our LinkedIn jobs page and to send us any recruits you think could be a good fit. I will also keep you updated on recruiting priorities. 

As of right now, our advisor recruiting focus is as follows:

Reno, NV: Opportunity to join an existing team and to take over part of a book of business. Marketing focused team that generates leads through a TV program. Recently hired a service-focused advisor and would now like to hire a sales-focused advisor.
Wichita, KS: Current office is one experienced advisor. We would like to add another advisor with a book of business who can help us grow in that location. 
Tampa, FL: Current office is two advisors and one support staff. One advisor focuses on wealth and the other focuses on retirement plans. We would like to add another wealth advisor with a book of business who can help us grow in that location.
Los Angeles, CA: We currently have 3 advisors and ~$550m in the Los Angeles area. We are looking to add experienced advisors with portable books of business. 
Charleston, SC: Current office is a senior advisor, one junior advisor, one paraplanner and one client service/admin. We have a beautiful new office with space to grow. We would like to add experienced advisors with a book of business. 
Nashville, TN: Current office is two advisors, support staff, Prime's head of HR and Prime's internal recruiter. Beautiful office in Franklin, TN with room to grow. We would like to add advisors with a book of business. 
Dallas, TX: Currently have two offices. One in Flower Mound, TX, which is more established, and one in The Galleria, which we launched this year. We are currently building out brand new office space in The Galleria and we will have room to grow. We would like to add advisors with a book of business. 
St. Louis, MO: Currently one advisor who joined us this year. We would like to add additional advisors with a book of business to grow in that market.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.330
Steve Perry: Is there a pretty? Is there? Is there some direct flights between Kansas City and.

24
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:09.750
Grant Spencer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have 3 direct flights per day. It's like an hour, 15 min. So it's it's super easy. Last night was not easy. I'm here this week, actually, last night there was an issue at the Point. We are fully boarded.

25
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:21.609
Grant Spencer: Issue with the plane we had to deboard. We had to get a new plane. I had like 3, 3 and a half hours of delays for a hour and 15 min flight. So that's never fun. But what was that?

26
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.560
Steve Perry: American.

27
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.250
Grant Spencer: Southwest southwest.

28
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.069
Grant Spencer: Yeah, it's been funny. When I when I started this job 2 and a half years ago, I actually came every single week for my 1st year.

29
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:43.150
Grant Spencer: which is a lot, and then I've kind of scaled it back to every other week, and sometimes even more, as needed, you know, maybe maybe once a month, every once in a while. But when I started there was 2 American flights to Southwest.

30
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.420
Grant Spencer: then American discontinued both.

31
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.690
Grant Spencer: and then it was just 2 southwest, then south southwest, added one. So right right now we're at 3 southwest.

32
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.410
Steve Perry: Right?

33
00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:09.490
Steve Perry: Yeah, I lived in Lubbock for a couple of years, and so that was, you know, we had the Southwest, and we had American, and I always flew. And my, you know, my managers typically would drive. We'd go to Dallas a lot. And so half the time they would win driving half the time I would win, flying with delays.

34
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.480
Grant Spencer: Yeah, yeah. I stopped in Lubbock for the 1st time in July. Actually, my my wife and I were going out to Santa Fe

35
00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:21.719
Grant Spencer: New Mexico, and we we took our dogs with us. So we ended up driving stopped there. That was like our halfway point.

36
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.560
Steve Perry: Nice. Yeah, it was.

37
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.349
Steve Perry: I'm glad I don't live there anymore. It was.

38
00:03:26.703 --> 00:03:29.529
Grant Spencer: Yeah. Lubbock is in the middle of nowhere.

39
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.360
Steve Perry: Yeah.

40
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.750
Grant Spencer: Crazy.

41
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.859
Steve Perry: It is so. Yeah, so tell me, tell me about so what did you do prior to prime capital?

42
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.099
Grant Spencer: Yeah, yeah, maybe we can. If it works for you, Steve, what I typically do for these, I'll introduce myself briefly. First, st just to understand who I am. My role here

43
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:53.949
Grant Spencer: would love to then hear the same from you, more about you, your your career, your firm today, and then on the back end I can give you some information on prime capital.

44
00:03:54.267 --> 00:04:00.950
Grant Spencer: How we've been growing where we've been recruiting things like that. Just to understand our value proposition, and then answer any questions you have. Does that work.

45
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.230
Steve Perry: Yeah, definitely.

46
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.259
Grant Spencer: Okay, so my, my brief background

47
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.480
Grant Spencer: role here is M and A and recruiting

48
00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.109
Grant Spencer: so I work with a team of a few.

49
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:36.170
Grant Spencer: Somebody's walked by me here I work with a few people here focused on growth day to day. So we focus on again individual advisor recruits and acquisition opportunities. We've done a lot of both of those, and I'll give you some more background information on that. But we have really prospective conversations looking at new recruits, new acquisition opportunities. Our team works on the transition process. Once we find a compatible recruiter, acquisition candidate helping them get transition to prime capital.

50
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.580
Grant Spencer: And then, ultimately we, we work on integration, making sure.

51
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.080
Steve Perry: Yeah.

52
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:56.769
Grant Spencer: Every person, every team that joins us. We're leveraging whatever unique expertise that individual brings to the table. But making sure that they're able to leverage all the resources here as well. So that's my day to day role. I grew up. My background is, I grew up in Kansas City, where prime capital is based, or Overland Park. Casey suburb

53
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.989
Grant Spencer: went to middle school and high school, there went to the East Coast for college. I studied finance at Wake Forest in North Carolina. So I spent 4 years there

54
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:17.929
Grant Spencer: after college. I did an investment banking analyst program at Wells, Fargo. They had their investment banking headquarters in Charlotte. So I spent 2 years in Charlotte in that program. Great learning experience wasn't for me long. Term.

55
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.369
Grant Spencer: Ended up moving to Austin to work for Dimensional Fund advisors. Are you familiar with them?

56
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.010
Steve Perry: -

57
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:35.609
Grant Spencer: Okay, dimensional is a top 10 asset manager in the Us. So they they manage about 800 billion dollars based out of Austin, Texas, 13 global offices. Pretty unique investment philosophy there. But I spent more.

58
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:56.459
Grant Spencer: more or less just over 4 years there in business development and relationship management within the financial institution space. So I covered the wirehouse platforms. I covered insurance companies. Big financial institutions like that servicing assets we had across some of those platforms and then obviously working to grow our asset base across those platforms as well.

59
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:19.510
Grant Spencer: So did that for just over 4 years got broad-based exposure to the wealth space working with the wirehouse firms dimensional had a big focus on the independent financial advisory space. So I just got I got broad-based exposure and perspective on the wealth space during my time there and then this opportunity, with Prime, came up again 2 and a half years ago, which was kind of the perfect fit of my background. I had the

60
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.170
Grant Spencer: transactional experience early in my career in investment banking. And then I had the

61
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:32.298
Grant Spencer: business development sales. People skills type component and and wealth experience. During my time at dimensional. So it's been a really good fit. So

62
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:40.380
Grant Spencer: that's a little bit about me. And again based in Austin, married for 2 years with my wife for 11 years. 2 dogs, no kids yet.

63
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.019
Grant Spencer: Yes, that's a little bit about me.

64
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:53.810
Steve Perry: Very cool, very, very cool. And so you are, day in and day out, having conversations with with different teams or solo advisors that are.

65
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.080
Grant Spencer: Individual recruits, teams, acquisitions. Yeah, all, all 3 of those. Yeah.

66
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.379
Steve Perry: Okay. Okay, very cool, very cool.

67
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.210
Steve Perry: How are you liking it? So far? 2 and a half.

68
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.080
Grant Spencer: Oh, I love it, I mean and again I'll give you more background. Would it be helpful if I just went straight into

69
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.180
Grant Spencer: our company, too?

70
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.840
Steve Perry: Yeah, tell me about. I'd love to hear it.

71
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.680
Grant Spencer: Turn, turn it to you and complete. So the how much do you know about prime capital.

72
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.950
Steve Perry: I don't. Nope.

73
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.790
Grant Spencer: Okay.

74
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.170
Grant Spencer: So the prime capital story is this firm was founded in the 19 eighties

75
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:41.800
Grant Spencer: under the name Longing Financial. It was named after a guy named Gary Lawing, and really was founded in the early days as an insurance firm. So they were doing. I love your watch, by the way, big watch person so founded in the early days, focused on insurance. They did life insurance and annuities for high net worth individuals. Back in the 19 eighties.

76
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.800
Grant Spencer: 10 years into the Company's history. Mid 90 s.

77
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.409
Grant Spencer: 2 advisors were recruited from Edward Jones, Scott, Colangelo, and Tim Hakes. They're still here today.

78
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:59.039
Grant Spencer: They joined lawing financial at the time they've been at Edward Jones. They had both built wealth books of business north of a hundred 1 million dollars in their young thirties, so they've been.

79
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.250
Steve Perry: This is in the eighties.

80
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.350
Grant Spencer: This is in the nineties.

81
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.530
Steve Perry: Nineties, wow!

82
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:16.640
Grant Spencer: So they're in their thirties. They've been really successful. Early in their careers. They they were recruited to long financial, really to build out the wealth management, financial planning, investment division of that company at that point in time. So they joined in the nineties

83
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:26.379
Grant Spencer: over the next 2 decades. From there they recruited other advisors. We opened up a few, a few different office locations. And basically what happened was by 2017.

84
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:37.909
Grant Spencer: The business was about 95% wealth management and retirement plan consulting. And that legacy insurance business line that it was founded on was really only 5% of the revenues at that point. In time it became very small.

85
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:50.880
Grant Spencer: The initial founder owned all the Equity, Scott and Tim. All these advisors they'd recruited had no ownership, and really they've been the ones building the value of the firm. And so that arrangement, you know, long story short, wasn't working out and

86
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.240
Steve Perry: That long with.

87
00:08:52.240 --> 00:09:04.699
Grant Spencer: Yeah. So so they basically, what happened was they, they went to the prior owner and they said, 2 options here, option one, we're gonna take our clients, go set up our own firm down the street, do our own thing. Option 2. We'll buy the firm from you at the latest valuation.

88
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.490
Grant Spencer: and so the the prior owner came back, slept on it.

89
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.859
Grant Spencer: decided to sell them. The firm he exited to continue.

90
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.530
Steve Perry: That doesn't sound like much of a choice.

91
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:39.079
Grant Spencer: Yeah, right so. And and again, he wanted to focus on insurance. These advisors should have had ownership in what they've been building, you know. So and and there was a good platform here. So these 4 advisors bought the firm in 2017. That's when we rebranded prime capital. That's when we hired our current leadership team. And that's where, really, if you look up anything relative to prime capital online, all of our growth is really stem from that 2,017 buyout

92
00:09:39.836 --> 00:09:43.830
Grant Spencer: at that point. In time we were about 2.7 billion in total aum.

93
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:49.099
Grant Spencer: We were about 30 financial advisors. And we were in 7 locations primarily focused in the Midwest.

94
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:57.779
Grant Spencer: If you fast forward to today. We're about 32 billion today in total UN, so we've grown over tenfold from an asset perspective.

95
00:09:58.074 --> 00:10:10.320
Grant Spencer: We've gone from 30 advisors to 200 advisors. We've gone from 7 locations to about 50 physical office locations throughout the Us. So we've had a a pretty good growth run here. And you know, that's come through really 3 channels

96
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:19.719
Grant Spencer: organic. First, st that's always priority number one for us. Our organic growth is averaged over 10% a year since 2,017. So that's stripped of.

97
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.169
Steve Perry: With market growth, or just new.

98
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:29.890
Grant Spencer: Market, no market growth, no acquisitions, no recruiting just organically growing on average north of 10% a year since 2,017.

99
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:46.459
Grant Spencer: So we're super proud of that number one. Then we've done a lot of the inorganic growth as well. So on the acquisition front we've done 25 firm team acquisitions all throughout the country, ranging from sizes as small as 150 million to as big as 1.7 billion

100
00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:51.739
Grant Spencer: so it's been kind of a wide range there. I'd say that 400 to 500 million marks kind of the average.

101
00:10:52.113 --> 00:10:58.959
Grant Spencer: We have another one actually under loi that will close by the end of January, so active in the M. And a space constantly looking for

102
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:28.870
Grant Spencer: high quality people, high quality firms that can join prime capital leverage our resources and continue growing. And then we've done a lot of individual advisor recruiting as well. So I mean dozens and dozens of advisors all throughout the country, sometimes opening up a new office location, sometimes joining an existing team. Almost always growth oriented. We're we're more growth focused than succession focused. But we've done tons and tons of that as well. Just to give you a sense. I mean, this year we, I think we're on track. We have one more advisor scheduled to start in 3 weeks.

103
00:11:29.227 --> 00:11:41.719
Grant Spencer: And that'll put us at at about a billion 2 in in all fee based aum that that moved here this year. So you know, 12 million in revenue just just from that. So we're we're very active on the individual recruiting front as well.

104
00:11:42.484 --> 00:11:46.320
Grant Spencer: So that's the high level. Do you want me to give you some of the differentiators real quick, and then I'll actually.

105
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.519
Steve Perry: Yeah. Yeah. And then, like, how does yeah, how your model works, which I'm sure is in your differentiators.

106
00:11:50.520 --> 00:12:15.690
Grant Spencer: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so a few things. Differentiators. Number one. We always say we're advisor, led advisor, governed Advisor owned, which I think is very different. Of all the other top 20 ras in the country. Advisor leadership. Scott and Tim were those 2 advisors who came over in the nineties. They were 2 of the 4 that bought the firm in 2017, Scott's our chairman, Tim's our vice chairman, while also their primary roles day to day are as advisors

107
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.500
Grant Spencer: as advisors like. They sit in the advisor seat day to day. They have 2 at the top.

108
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:39.389
Grant Spencer: 5 individual books of business here internally. So you really get that advisory thought leadership from the top down here, which I think is important while having a professional management team, though, like our our CEO spent 3 decades growing and scaling businesses. Our Cfos held Cfo roles within private and public companies. So you get this good balance of advisor thought leadership with professional management.

109
00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:44.879
Grant Spencer: Advisor Governance. We have 4 different advisory boards here comprised of our top advisors throughout the country.

110
00:12:45.190 --> 00:13:13.290
Grant Spencer: They get together regularly and set the vision and the direction of the firm that the leadership team that executes on and then advisor ownership, contrary to what it was prior about 150 of our 200 advisors have an equity stake in prime capital. And so we want it to be that way, going forward over 65% of the equity is actually held internally between advisors and the leadership team. And so every advisor that gets to a certain production threshold, we want to offer equity and make sure that they become a partner of the firm.

111
00:13:13.857 --> 00:13:15.110
Grant Spencer: So that's a.

112
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.739
Steve Perry: 35, 35% is.

113
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.750
Grant Spencer: Yeah. So we have a minority private equity partner

114
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:38.040
Grant Spencer: partners, they're out of Boston. They own about 15%. And then our largest individual client who's kind of helped us with growth in the years he has his own family. He's worth billions of dollars. He had his own family office. He helped us with some of our debt, financing historically. Now he's more involved, just from an equity capacity. But he has a 20% stake as well.

115
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.360
Steve Perry: And so that you've got you've got a

116
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.279
Steve Perry: pretty deep war chest for all the M. And A. You want to do.

117
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.380
Grant Spencer: Yeah, yeah, I mean, between, yeah, with Avery, too, yeah, absolutely absolutely.

118
00:13:48.103 --> 00:13:54.179
Grant Spencer: So and then we're also so a couple of other things I mentioned. We're we're a partnership of unique practitioners. And what I mean by that.

119
00:13:54.748 --> 00:14:20.380
Grant Spencer: You know, contrary to maybe a creative planning or Edelman financial engines where you have some leadership team giving them a cookie cutter model that everyone has to implement. All throughout the country. We look more like a we're a professional services firm. We look more like a Bain or a Mckinsey or a global law firm where we have different people with with different expertise all throughout the country who share those ideas, and and, you know, help each other grow. So you might.

120
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:27.070
Grant Spencer: I think what looks different here is, you might have some advisors that only focus on the ultra network space and won't take a client for less than 25 million.

121
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:34.350
Grant Spencer: while you also might have some advisors that focus on us postal workers or some advisors that focus on the medical space, or some advisors that focus on.

122
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.940
Grant Spencer: you know, a planning process, whatever it might be

123
00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:50.280
Grant Spencer: and so I think that that those unique practitioners all throughout the country sharing ideas as part of that partnership really really makes us different. We also, we have 2 primary business lines. So wealth management's about 80% of our revenues.

124
00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:59.099
Grant Spencer: Retirement plan consulting and financial wellness is about 20 been in both those business lines for 20 years, and there's a lot of synergies in both directions. There.

125
00:14:59.100 --> 00:14:59.770
Steve Perry: Yeah.

126
00:15:00.388 --> 00:15:09.651
Grant Spencer: And then in terms of platform, I mean, we. We have everything you'd ex expect of a platform our size centralized investment team, about 40 proprietary strategies managed in House.

127
00:15:10.497 --> 00:15:16.909
Grant Spencer: You can kind of think of our investment platform in 4 bands, core asset allocation models at the center

128
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:28.410
Grant Spencer: basic asset allocation strategies. We then have a suite of satellite portfolios. Those are a little bit more bespoke things like we have a focused equity focus, yield covered call sector rotation strategies like those

129
00:15:28.776 --> 00:15:33.039
Grant Spencer: we then do. The 3rd band is custom portfolio management. So for a million dollars plus.

130
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.470
Grant Spencer: we have a team of portfolio managers that will custom manage a strategy specific to client need.

131
00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:56.299
Grant Spencer: And then we have our own. The final band is private investments. We have our own self, sourced self, due diligence, private investment, platform, private equity, venture, capital, private credit, real estate, things like that which caters more to the high net worth clientele, centralized financial planning resources. We have e-money and money guide, pro

132
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.680
Grant Spencer: holistic plan for tax planning, nitrogen for risk analysis, wealth.com for state, planning things like that

133
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:21.340
Grant Spencer: centralized marketing team. I think of marketing a little bit more individualized. We obviously do the corporate level brand building throughout the country. But we also we sit down with every advisor, every team that joins us, every market, and get to understand who they are, who, how, who they work with how they want to go to market. And we build customized marketing strategies by market and by advisor.

134
00:16:22.455 --> 00:16:29.609
Grant Spencer: So yeah, we have insurance resources. We have a primary Imo partner. Quantum out of Scott as out of Scottsdale that we work with on that front.

135
00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:34.100
Grant Spencer: What else? That's kind of the high level. I'll probably pause there, but.

136
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:39.490
Steve Perry: What? What your your internal team infrastructure like? How big is that team.

137
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.919
Grant Spencer: Yeah. So if you look at us as a as a whole.

138
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.520
Grant Spencer: And so again, 200 advisors.

139
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:50.379
Grant Spencer: I'd say we have about a hundred 5,200 people. That are in

140
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.339
Grant Spencer: operational type, you know whether it's Home Office roles on finance and accounting and

141
00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:06.110
Grant Spencer: my type team, or, you know, compliance or marketing, or the financial planning team, or admins things like that. About 3 50 to 400 people, total with 200 advisors.

142
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:12.040
Steve Perry: Or and then are your advisors? Are they employees? Are they? W. 2, or are they 1099.

143
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:19.200
Grant Spencer: Yeah. So of those 200 any that are equity partners are k, 1 part owners, and Llc.

144
00:17:19.507 --> 00:17:28.949
Grant Spencer: of that remaining 50 vast majority are 1099 s. And then we do have a few, you know, getting earlier in their career, people getting started. That might be w twos, but

145
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:35.339
Grant Spencer: almost every equity partners. Okay, one. Almost all the rest are 1099, and a few W. Twos scattered in there.

146
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.320
Steve Perry: Okay.

147
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:46.883
Steve Perry: super interesting. And so you you said you're bringing on 3, 4, 5, new groups a year teams a year, practices.

148
00:17:47.490 --> 00:18:01.240
Grant Spencer: Yeah, that's been about the average, I mean last year we did an acquisition in January, which was about 500 million out of Pasadena, and then we closed another one in March out of Reno, Nevada. That was about 400 million.

149
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:11.019
Grant Spencer: and then we brought on 5 teams from a bank. Actually, that totaled up to about they're all from the same one. They totaled up to about 2 billion. So you know, about

150
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:21.069
Grant Spencer: 300 million on average across those across those 5. So that was last year. And then on the recruiting front, like, I said, this year, we're on pace for a billion to in recruits with about.

151
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.579
Grant Spencer: I call it 10 to 12 of them, about a hundred 1 million dollar average per group.

152
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.750
Steve Perry: Yeah, you've been busy.

153
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.088
Grant Spencer: We've been busy, that is, that is, for sure.

154
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.060
Steve Perry: Good for you guys.

155
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.639
Grant Spencer: All good stuff, though. Yeah, no, I mean, it's it's an exciting place to be right now. And

156
00:18:35.259 --> 00:18:39.150
Grant Spencer: continue to continue to attract new people continue to invest in the platform.

157
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.350
Grant Spencer: Yeah, it's it's pretty amazing. We've gotten to where

158
00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.489
Grant Spencer: where we are in this sort of a period of time.

159
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.249
Steve Perry: That's phenomenal. Good for you, Grant.

160
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:50.540
Steve Perry: That's a.

161
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.479
Grant Spencer: Not me, not on me. We have a good team here. I think you you'd.

162
00:18:53.480 --> 00:19:08.170
Steve Perry: Well, yeah, but it, you know, I I like, we're a big believer like, just even in our company, like, I've tried to create it a little bit different where everyone can work in their strengths and not have to wear too many different hats, but really do what they they're passionate about doing all day long. So

163
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.109
Steve Perry: until that, you know you're in the right spot for that. So.

164
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.950
Grant Spencer: For sure, for sure.

165
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:12.840
Steve Perry: Great. Find?

166
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.010
Steve Perry: Yeah.

167
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.969
Grant Spencer: No, absolutely no, it's been. It's been a really fun place to be.

168
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:23.360
Steve Perry: What are you finding like? What are? What are you finding is your

169
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.669
Steve Perry: like? I love talking to these guys because it's a no brainer.

170
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:38.679
Grant Spencer: Yeah, I mean, the the perfect fit for us is that entrepreneur that wants to be part of a bigger team. And so what I mean by that is, we find a lot of people that are either in a big

171
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:49.699
Grant Spencer: corporate institutional environment like a bank channel or an Edelman financial engines or environments like that, where they can't have any creativity. They can't be an entrepreneur like they'd like to.

172
00:19:50.153 --> 00:20:02.109
Grant Spencer: We're the perfect fit where they can come, join us. Really, we're gonna let them have autonomy run their practice how they see fit, while also tapping into this platform with great resources to help them grow.

173
00:20:02.423 --> 00:20:04.200
Grant Spencer: So the way we always talk about

174
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:28.920
Grant Spencer: kind of what an advisor might handle locally and what we handle anything back, office oriented, whether it's office space or admin support or compliance or facilities technology stuff like that. We want to handle all that in house. If if some advisor wants to do all that running the business type stuff. They're probably not going to be a good fit for us. We want people that want to offload all that stuff to us. We do it really well. We do it in a high quality manner.

175
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:39.600
Grant Spencer: which then frees up that advisors time to focus on their clients, focus on all the resources here that can help them grow, so that that tends to be the best fit, I mean, and I can go through the economics here, too.

176
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:45.490
Grant Spencer: But yeah, entrepreneurs who don't want to go out, hang their own shingle and do it all on their own

177
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.790
Grant Spencer: but want to have enough autonomy to kind of run their practice day to day. How

178
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.739
Grant Spencer: they prefer anything that touches the client. We're fairly flexible on.

179
00:20:54.097 --> 00:20:57.569
Grant Spencer: whether that's investment, philosophy, or planning process or marketing approach.

180
00:20:57.981 --> 00:21:00.509
Grant Spencer: Things that touch the client. We tread lightly on.

181
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.390
Steve Perry: And

182
00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:08.859
Steve Perry: and what do they give up? I mean, what do they give up for that right? Or is it? Do you guys operate on a grid model, or.

183
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:33.720
Grant Spencer: Yeah. So so here's how the Comp looks here. First, st you have that. It depends on where they're coming from. If people are breaking from somewhere where they already, where they have non-competes, not soliciting some some sort of legal agreement in place we cover legal support, so we we indemnify them completely for legal and settlement costs. So that's you know, that can be a big differentiator depending on where they're coming from and and where else they're looking that's not always covered.

184
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.350
Steve Perry: Go after the clients. Then.

185
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:37.000
Grant Spencer: 100%. Yeah.

186
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.959
Steve Perry: Yeah. Nice. Okay.

187
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:45.200
Grant Spencer: And I can give you more information on that. And yes, I mean, we have. We have a process we've built around that with guidance from council.

188
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.600
Steve Perry: Sure.

189
00:21:45.600 --> 00:22:01.229
Grant Spencer: Cover that piece. On the. So we have the equity program. We want every our threshold. There is any advisor who does 400,000 recurring revenue, or 500,000 in total revenue we offer partnership to. That's not that high of a hurdle.

190
00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.830
Grant Spencer: So we have the equity program.

191
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:12.849
Grant Spencer: and then the the kind of day to day compensation, the way it works here is we have a grid tiered by client size. With this, with a suggested fee.

192
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:26.730
Grant Spencer: And again, we want our advisors to be entrepreneurs, so we let our advisors charge their clients. Whatever fee they feel is appropriate within reason. You know, someone can't be charging 7% fees, but so we let them charge whatever fee they feel is appropriate.

193
00:22:27.283 --> 00:22:30.969
Grant Spencer: If they charge our suggested fee, they get a 45% payout.

194
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:37.930
Grant Spencer: If they charge above our grid, they retain a hundred percent of the difference, and if they charge below the grid it eats into their pay.

195
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:45.859
Grant Spencer: So just to give you a sense of, we give them autonomy to make the the fee decision. For the most part, our average feels 45%.

196
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:46.620
Steve Perry: Okay.

197
00:22:47.203 --> 00:22:50.889
Grant Spencer: And and it's a clean 45, too. Again, we're covering office space and.

198
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:51.310
Steve Perry: Yup!

199
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.010
Grant Spencer: Admin support and tech stack and all that type of stuff.

200
00:22:54.380 --> 00:23:00.529
Steve Perry: So did they? Yeah. So like, I need a, I need a Afa for my team. You guys provide that

201
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:01.339
Steve Perry: based on.

202
00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.680
Grant Spencer: Yeah, within reason.

203
00:23:04.103 --> 00:23:20.450
Grant Spencer: Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, it's within reason. And all this is a case by case basis. I mean somebody. If somebody has a million revenue, we're obviously not gonna hire them like 3 people that doesn't make sense. But you know, we're business people, and we're trying to operate our business at a particular margin. Within reason, and so

204
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.559
Grant Spencer: as advisors grow, we invest more money with them.

205
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.380
Steve Perry: Yeah.

206
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.030
Steve Perry: Yeah. Super. Good.

207
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:31.170
Grant Spencer: And then the last piece of comp is we have a retirement benefit as well. And so the way that works is.

208
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:36.930
Grant Spencer: and this is in our in our member agreement. We guarantee advisors a minimum

209
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.079
Grant Spencer: buyout, basically to transition their book internally upon retirement.

210
00:23:41.440 --> 00:24:03.880
Grant Spencer: But we don't. We actually, we don't want the company to be the one purchasing the book. So what we then do is we allow them to find another advisor internally, and negotiate whatever deal they can get done to sell their book internally. So advisors basically own their books internally at prime. And then a lot of times, what they're able to do is sell their book, monetize their book to transition internally for about 2 X revenue

211
00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:07.439
Grant Spencer: upon retirement. And then the way we do the way we structure. That is.

212
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:36.149
Grant Spencer: you just use the revenue and the payout of the book to pay that out over a period of 4 or 5 years. So an advisor might say, year one, I'm going to take 80% of the Comp and just be available on an as needed basis. Year 2, I'm going to take 75% and just waterfall it down from there. And again, the the most recent deals we've done. They're getting 2 X revenue paid out over a period of 4 to 5 years, just using the revenue and income from the book, and that younger advisor gives them an opportunity

213
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:41.750
Grant Spencer: owner, advisor, creates monetization, and then for the clients, it creates continuity, which is right for the client. You know.

214
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.149
Steve Perry: That's good. Good.

215
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:53.899
Steve Perry: Yeah, that's a great model. I like it. I mean, I hear hear a lot of these, and you hear a lot, too. So.

216
00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:04.640
Grant Spencer: Yeah, I mean, what you find here is like, everything here has been designed with the advisors, hat in mind, right? Like what is best for the client again. A lot of people in our leadership team are advisors day to day. So

217
00:25:04.933 --> 00:25:13.480
Grant Spencer: we we've really tried to. I think a lot of things you'd find here is we always err on the side of the advisor and on on the side of the client, in terms of how we've designed things here.

218
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.309
Steve Perry: It's good. Okay?

219
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:23.667
Steve Perry: Well, when when it comes to, I mean, do you work with recruiting firms at all?

220
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.339
Grant Spencer: Yeah, yeah. So we have a.

221
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:37.649
Grant Spencer: we have an in-house recruiter, Amanda. So we do have somebody internally that day to day focuses on direct outreach. But then we have about 20 recruiting relationships. I mean, we're always open to looking at

222
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:45.269
Grant Spencer: opportunities. If you can help us solve, for I mean, we have dozens and dozens of recruiting needs throughout the country. We try to focus on.

223
00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.960
Grant Spencer: you know, 3 to 5 at a time and then work down our list. But

224
00:25:49.413 --> 00:25:56.749
Grant Spencer: yeah, I mean, we have tons of opportunities throughout the country, and we work with a lot of recruiters, and we're always open to looking at high quality candidates.

225
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.030
Steve Perry: Okay, talk. Talk to me about a couple of those relationships.

226
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.419
Grant Spencer: Yeah, I mean, they vary. So so here's how ours.

227
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:14.999
Grant Spencer: we, we okay, here's here's what I would say. We did one on a retained basis where we were paying them a monthly fee to get X amount of candidates that did not go well.

228
00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:31.090
Grant Spencer: We paid a bunch of money. We got one person close. They're somewhat subpar relative to the other recruiting. We've done so. We have not been fans of that model. Everything else we've done is on a contingent basis. Where? And again, the the arrangements typically will do

229
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.520
Grant Spencer: if it's a salaried position which is

230
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:47.739
Grant Spencer: rare on the advisor side, I mean, or this is a commission based structure. Right? We do. But if we do hire a junior advisor or something like that on the salary side, we'll typically, do you know 20 to 25% of your one comp and as a payout to to.

231
00:26:49.568 --> 00:26:51.480
Grant Spencer: If we do the kind of

232
00:26:52.580 --> 00:27:14.779
Grant Spencer: bringing a book to prime capital bringing revenue. The way we've done those are. It's about 6% of year, one revenue that moves we pay the recruiting firm. And what we'll typically do is pay 3% of that upfront based on what we expect, and then 3 to 6 months in, or we'll even wait up to a year if you wanted us to. We'll see what revenue actually moves and then pay that, you know, remaining 3%. Then

233
00:27:15.276 --> 00:27:18.090
Grant Spencer: so that's what the arrangements look like. But yeah, for the most part.

234
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:31.149
Grant Spencer: I'm kind of, you know, every every month, every month, or, you know, once a quarter, sending our recruiting partners a list of where we're trying to hire. We're also we keep our Linkedin page pretty regular regularly updated with

235
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.669
Grant Spencer: kind of our our focus list of what we're trying to hire for. And

236
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:41.899
Grant Spencer: and yeah, we get recruits that you know, we get opportunities that come through the door, and and we're always open to looking for good people. So.

237
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.440
Steve Perry: And what about like your internal hires?

238
00:27:47.301 --> 00:27:49.409
Grant Spencer: You mean like just staff throughout the.

239
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:50.590
Steve Perry: Yeah. Like, when you got recruited.

240
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.599
Grant Spencer: Not non advisors. Yeah, those. So

241
00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:11.359
Grant Spencer: I focus on M. And A and recruiting more advisor focused recruiting. And then we have an Hr team which Amanda, who does the in-house recruiting. She's part of that team with our head of Hr. Trish. They kind of focus more on any of those positions. So if it's an investment position, if it's a planning team position, if it's a

242
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:19.299
Grant Spencer: client service position, whatever it might be. But yeah, we I mean, we obviously have plenty of those as well as we continue to grow and build out our presence all throughout the country.

243
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.510
Steve Perry: Okay. Okay.

244
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.060
Grant Spencer: Yep.

245
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.810
Steve Perry: Yeah, super helpful So

246
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:36.056
Steve Perry: our. So you know, I'd say our firm is is maybe well, every firm says they're different. Right?

247
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:44.530
Steve Perry: I did not start well in my background, right? So I spent 17 years at New York Life Insurance Company. I know we got 1 min left.

248
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.759
Grant Spencer: No, no, wait, let me just check my, I think if you're good, I think I Yeah, I have 30 min. If you're good.

249
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.730
Steve Perry: Okay, let me let me just text my team real quick.

250
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.830
Steve Perry: It's an internal meeting I have. So one second.

251
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:05.339
Grant Spencer: Obviously over the 4 30. But you have 5 or 10 min. Maybe we can get some background.

252
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.830
Steve Perry: So so I spent 17 years at New York. Life was

253
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:39.790
Steve Perry: traditional insurance. Bd advisor for my 1st 5 years, you know, right out of college. Moved into leadership recruiting building a team of advisors, you know, agents, advisors,

254
00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:55.079
Steve Perry: moved up, got, you know, became managing partner. Ran a firm in Lubbock. And then and then la! Most recently here in Minneapolis Twin Cities area. So I ran, you know the New York life office up here with

255
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.396
Steve Perry: roughly a hundred advisors.

256
00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:08.130
Steve Perry: and became super corporate. You know, that used to be, you know, being a managing partner, used to be pretty autonomous, entrepreneurial, and it just

257
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:15.139
Steve Perry: the that wasn't the writing on the wall. So I left last year I thought I was gonna buy a firm

258
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.660
Steve Perry: and

259
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:36.260
Steve Perry: ended up following through the week before I left. And so I I, you know, thought about like, what did I really enjoy doing? And I love. I love recruiting. Now I will, I will. So so the original solution we built I I've never been in executive recruiting never worked in executive, you know

260
00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:49.210
Steve Perry: if if staffing none of that. So I I built this from a kind of like, how you guys are from an advisor's perspective. I I built this from a guy leading and building a firm's perspective, what would they want? A solution provided to them?

261
00:30:50.390 --> 00:31:05.989
Steve Perry: And a big challenge like cause like you said right. A lot of it's commission only, and a lot of what we were doing was inexperienced advisor recruiting. So I'm not gonna pay a head hunting firm, you know, 1015, 20 grand per placement, because I don't know if this guy's gonna make it. And he's still gotta get licensed.

262
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:17.640
Steve Perry: So I I really built a solution that was based on activity. Because, you know, running a firm. I knew if I did these many interviews I would hire these many people which on average would produce this much

263
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:34.239
Steve Perry: all the way down. So so I built our original solution we built was was based on that where, hey? We will do all of the the sourcing, all the cold calling, all the scheduling, all the initial interviews to just put the best candidates in front of you. You pay us per month, based on how many of those you want us to do.

264
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:50.850
Steve Perry: And so that's that's kind of that's really our bed bread and butter product that it's it's a fit for kind of the the insurance insurance broker dealer, constantly recruiting new inexperienced producers. Product.

265
00:31:51.110 --> 00:32:00.760
Steve Perry: Candidly, I'm most passionate about it. Grant, like you, you see the industry and the average age of the industry growing more and more and more, and like I, I

266
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:10.169
Steve Perry: I know why people play in your world, because, like it's, there's a it's harder to get people to move, but when they do move it's a it's a big payoff

267
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.460
Steve Perry: so I haven't.

268
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:38.000
Steve Perry: So so that wasn't the original product. Then then we've had these Rias come to us and say, Hey, I I need. I need this. I need you to hire this. I need you to hire that. This we need 3 new salespeople. And so what we'll do is we'll, basically, you know, take this similar model, this engine that we have that that we know can find any candidates anywhere, and schedule interviews with them and do initial interviews, and just send the best candidates to them, so

269
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:55.759
Steve Perry: they'll they'll bring us on as kind of their in house recruiting team, and they'll pay us, you know, a certain monthly subscription to that, and then a reduced success fee. So we're both, you know, invested in success in that. And then and then finally. So that's a that's a bigger model. Right? There's there's a few 1,000 of those

270
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.060
Steve Perry: that need that. And then

271
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:27.769
Steve Perry: and then finally, we work with, you know the solo advisor or the small team that's like, Hey, I need. I needed assistant. I need an Afa. I need an office manager, and that's just a purely regular like contingent, you know, model where it's a 1 off. But I I want to help those guys because I know that like that person is gonna help them and and their family, you know. Take that business to the next level. So those are kind of the 3 models that we serve. Now.

272
00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:47.180
Steve Perry: I'm saying that as a setup to say, like, obviously, every one of these conversations I have, it's like, Yeah, we've got. We need experienced advisors. We'll bring teams over, and you know they'll pay anywhere from 5 to 14% of the 12, the trailing 12 revenue, and as a finder's fee. I I will tell you.

273
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:59.359
Steve Perry: We have not been successful in that. We have placed a few you know, when we've been in house we've placed a few, but just the pure contingent model.

274
00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:22.670
Steve Perry: I get your perspective. You're like, I don't wanna pay for for just activity, and then my model is like like your value proposition sounds amazing. But ultimately I'm dependent on whether or not you can close the deal, and I have to dedicate resources for that. So, you know, there's some. So we've done the few where it's like a small retainer, and then, you know, a real big, you know, payout. If if it if it happens kind of thing.

275
00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:28.730
Steve Perry: So I all that to say I I mean I'd love happy to be on your list cause.

276
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.340
Grant Spencer: Yeah, yeah.

277
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:44.169
Steve Perry: Because we are recruiting, for you know, a couple of other firms that's not for experience advisors. That's not the right fit for them. But you know we'd love to have a play. Obviously that person said, Hey, I'm kind of open love to have a place to send them, and then.

278
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:58.379
Steve Perry: you know, no one like our our real, our real bread and butter is is in like. Let's like we'd love to fill all the different positions that you've got for you, for the Ria. For the team. You know that you're knowing you've got an in house team.

279
00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:12.910
Grant Spencer: Yeah, I mean on those especially just have your team monitor, our Linkedin page. Because that that gets updated, you know, multiple times a week with position positions we're trying to fill. So yeah, if you see anything there, I mean feel free to shoot any candidates you think could be a fit to

280
00:35:13.566 --> 00:35:26.090
Grant Spencer: trish or Trish Cooper needs Hr for us. And then Amanda Duggar is our internal recruiter. But yeah, if you guys monitor that and have any candidates you think could be a good fit. That's updated regularly, and then I'll keep you up to date, too, on

281
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:35.970

Steve Perry: Yeah, I'd love that, I don't. And you, if you got a distribution list you do with that, or or you know you're.

284
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:51.669
Grant Spencer: No, it's honestly, it's more just like it's more. It's more just custom. I'll just put together a list and ex explain each opportunity and send it out to people that

285
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.310
Grant Spencer: I talked to you so.

Steve Perry: re contingent contract, or anything like that that you have.

289
00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:14.470
Grant Spencer: We really don't. I can send you that language that we've typically done for the books of business that move you know I can do. I'll send you our firm overview deck that just gives you a high level on the firm.

290
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:29.729
Grant Spencer: We have this recruiting and acquisition criteria brochure. It's like 6 pages, talks about what we look for in acquisitions and recruits. I can send you that. And then I'll send you this this paragraph that just basically describes how we typically pay people when a book of business moves here.

291
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:37.630
Steve Perry: Okay, that'd be that'd be great. I'm like, obviously, I trust everybody. I'm just. I'm collecting, you know, some kind of formal agreement, you know.

292
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:44.510
Grant Spencer: Yeah, yeah, I mean, what would happen. Typically is recruited. Recruiting firms have their own agreement. They just plug in this language that we use into that.

293
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:50.100
Grant Spencer: Well, if you, if you have a standard agreement and we can use some some form of this language, we'll be fine with it.

294
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:50.580

1. Growth and Challenges
Current Growth:
Tony Drake highlights significant growth in their firm:

2024: Projected to end at $230 million.
Observes rapid expansion but believes the firm could grow even faster if not for a critical challenge: finding advisors.
Perception of Opportunity:

Tony believes their offering to advisors is unique and valuable.
Expresses confusion about why they aren't attracting advisors more easily, despite their compelling value proposition.
2. Business Model

High volume of leads, with clients having to wait 3–4 weeks for appointments due to demand.
3. Advisor Structure and Roles
Two Distinct Roles:

Lead Advisor:
Focused on sales and converting prospects.
Primary responsibility is onboarding new clients and showcasing the firm's value proposition.
Relationship Advisor:
Focused on client service and retention.
Different skill set, emphasizing strong interpersonal relationships and client care.
Key Challenge:

The relationship advisor side is doing well.
The sales advisor (lead advisor) role is critically understaffed.
4. Firm's Value Proposition to Advisors
Unique Selling Point:
Advisors ""will never have to prospect again.""
The firm handles lead generation entirely, removing the traditional pain point of client acquisition.
Insights and Opportunities
1. Recruitment Focus
The firm’s key challenge lies in recruiting Lead Advisors who excel in sales.

High demand for individuals skilled in presenting value propositions and closing deals.
Potential Proposal Element:

Develop a targeted recruiting strategy focused on attracting high-performing sales professionals.
Highlight the firm's unique lead generation model and independence from traditional prospecting as a major draw for candidates.
2. Talent Pipeline Development
With more demand than the current advisor team can handle, there’s a significant opportunity to:

Build a talent pipeline for future advisors.
Partner with recruiting specialists or leverage job platforms targeting sales and financial professionals.
Potential Proposal Element:

Recommend implementing a talent development program or partnership with universities/associations to groom potential advisors for the sales role.
3. Marketing the Value Proposition

Create a marketing campaign specifically targeting financial advisors or sales professionals looking for roles with:
Guaranteed leads.
No need for prospecting.
Focused responsibilities (either sales or client relationships).
Proposal Suggestions
Based on the conversation, here’s a high-level outline for a proposal:

Problem Identification:

The firm’s growth is hindered by a lack of sales-focused Lead Advisors.
The relationship advisor team is strong, but sales-side recruitment needs improvement.
Proposed Solutions:

Targeted Recruitment Campaign:
Leverage job boards, LinkedIn, and industry networks to identify and attract top sales talent.
Craft a compelling job description emphasizing the firm’s lead generation strength and specialization model.
Talent Development Program:
Develop a pipeline of future Lead Advisors through partnerships with training programs, universities, or sales associations.
Employer Branding Campaign:
Highlight the value proposition to prospective advisors: no prospecting, steady leads, and specialized roles.
Use testimonials and success stories from existing advisors to build credibility.
Execution Timeline:

Month 1: Define job descriptions and recruitment messaging.
Months 2–4: Execute recruitment campaigns and build talent pipeline relationships.
Ongoing: Review recruitment results and adjust strategy.
Outcome Goals:

Hire at least 2–3 high-performing Lead Advisors within 6 months.
Increase conversion rates for leads by ensuring an adequate number of sales-focused advisors.",zcrm_6221978000000914023,Steve Perry,,zcrm_6221978000047986021,Lead Advisor 1 (Grand Rapids) Drake & Assoc
