        <p><strong>Steve, you weren't being messed with!</strong> 😂</p>
        <p>The candidate in question is a <strong>Financial Planning Professional</strong> (7 years, CFP® candidate, Series 65).
        The "Percussionist" title was an AI mishap — the system latched onto their background as a former music major
        and professional percussionist instead of their actual financial services role.</p>
        <p><strong>What I fixed:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Changed title from "Percussionist Candidate Alert" to "Financial Planning Professional Candidate Alert"</li>
            <li>✅ Removed all scoring methodology and score displays (cleaner format for client forwarding)</li>
            <li>✅ Kept all 20 candidates with proper professional titles</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><em>This is the clean version ready to go. No more musical instruments in job titles! 🎵➡️💼</em></p>
