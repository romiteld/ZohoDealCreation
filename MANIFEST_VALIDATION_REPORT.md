## Production URLs
- **Manifest URL**: `https://well-intake-api.azurewebsites.net/manifest.xml`
- **Commands JS**: `https://well-intake-api.azurewebsites.net/commands.js`
- **Config JS**: `https://well-intake-api.azurewebsites.net/config.js`
- **API Endpoint**: `https://well-intake-api.azurewebsites.net/intake/email`

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Azure App Service:
```
API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 2. Install Add-in in Microsoft 365 Admin Center
1. Navigate to **Integrated Apps** → **Upload custom apps** → **Office Add-in**
2. Provide manifest URL: `https://well-intake-api.azurewebsites.net/manifest.xml`
3. Assign to authorized users

### 3. Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify manifest loads without errors
- [ ] Check "Send to Zoho" button appears in Outlook ribbon
- [ ] Test email processing with API key authentication
- [ ] Verify attachment handling
- [ ] Check success/error feedback displays correctly
- [ ] Test in Outlook Web and Desktop clients

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: 
   - API key is injected server-side from environment variable
   - Never hardcoded in client-side JavaScript
   - Transmitted via secure HTTPS only

2. **CORS Security**:
   - Configured to allow only specific Outlook domains
   - Credentials allowed for authenticated requests

3. **Input Validation**:
   - All email data validated before processing
   - Attachment size limits enforced (25MB)

## Known Limitations

1. Attachments over 25MB are not processed (metadata only)
2. Results dialog requires localStorage support
3. Add-in requires Office.js 1.1 minimum version
