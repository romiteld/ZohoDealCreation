## üìä Verification Scoring

- **100%** = ‚úÖ Safe for deployment
- **80-99%** = ‚ö†Ô∏è Review warnings, likely okay
- **<80%** = üö® Critical issues, do NOT deploy

## üîç Severity Levels

### üö® CRITICAL (Blocks Deployment)
1. **Firm Names** - Identifies exact employer
2. **ZIP Codes** - Pinpoints exact location
3. **Exact AUM** - Fingerprints specific advisor

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (Review Recommended)
4. **Universities** - May identify via education
5. **Unique Identifiers** - Rankings/achievements
6. **Specific Locations** - Suburbs instead of metros

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Fixes

### Pattern 1: Firm Name + AUM
```html
Before: "15 years at Merrill Lynch, managing $1.2B"
After:  "15 years at major wirehouse, managing $800M-$1.5B"
```

### Pattern 2: Education + Location
```html
Before: "Harvard MBA based in 78701 (Austin)"
After:  "MBA from prestigious institution based in Austin metro"
```

### Pattern 3: Achievement + Firm
```html
Before: "Chairman's Club at Morgan Stanley, #1 in region"
After:  "Elite performance tier at major wirehouse, top regional producer"
```

### Pattern 4: Specific Suburb
```html
Before: "Scottsdale practice with $450M AUM"
After:  "Phoenix metro practice with $400M-$600M AUM"
```

## üìù Checklist Before Deployment

- [ ] Run verification: `python3 verify_anonymization.py output/*.html`
- [ ] Check overall score is ‚â•80%
- [ ] Fix ALL critical issues (firms, ZIPs, exact AUM)
- [ ] Review warnings (universities, identifiers, locations)
- [ ] Verify ranges used instead of exact figures
- [ ] Confirm major metros used instead of suburbs
- [ ] Manual spot-check for edge cases
- [ ] Test email rendering in Outlook
- [ ] Deploy via scheduler

## üîß Troubleshooting

### False Positive: Geographic "Florida"
```html
‚ùå Flagged: "market presence in South Florida"
‚úÖ Actually OK: It's a geographic reference, not "University of Florida"
```
**Fix**: Script now detects geographic context automatically.

### False Positive: Generic "business school"
```html
‚ùå Flagged: "graduate of prestigious business school"
‚úÖ Actually OK: Generic phrase, not specific institution
```
**Fix**: Script filters out generic phrases when preceded by "prestigious/top-tier".

### Missing Detection: Misspelled Firm
```html
‚ö†Ô∏è Not caught: "Merill Linch" (typo)
```
**Solution**: Add common misspellings to FIRM_NAMES list in script.

## üìà Integration with CI/CD

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate + Verify + Deploy pipeline

python3 app/jobs/vault_alerts_generator.py --output output/alerts.html

if python3 verify_anonymization.py --strict output/alerts.html; then
    echo "‚úÖ Verification passed - deploying"
    python3 app/jobs/vault_alerts_scheduler.py
else
    echo "üö® Verification failed - halting deployment"
    exit 1
fi
```
