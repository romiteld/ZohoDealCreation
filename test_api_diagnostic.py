Additional notes:

Looking to learn about the TheWell. Not sure if I need your services but I do have an idea of what I'm looking for in the future.

Plan to hire 2 new lead advisors as soon as possible. I have a preliminary offer out to one at this time. Then hire a third CSA in 2026. Then hire two associate advisors in 2027. Then hire another lead advisor, probably in 2028.

Currently in Tulsa, planning to open up a 2nd office OKC, and potentially a 3rd office in Bentonville area.

Best of luck on your search!
